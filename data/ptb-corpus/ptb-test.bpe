 no it was n't black monday 
 but while the new y@@ ork stock exchange did n't fall apart friday as the d@@ ow j@@ ones industrial average plun@@ ged N points most of it in the final hour it barely managed to stay this side of chaos 
 some circuit brea@@ kers installed after the oc@@ to@@ ber N crash failed their first test tra@@ ders say unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures 
 the N stock specialist firms on the big board floor the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the N crash once again could n't handle the selling pressure 
 big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the be@@ le@@ agu@@ ered floor tra@@ ders by buying big blocks of stock tra@@ ders say

 when the dollar is in a <@@ unk@@ > even central banks ca n't stop it 
 specul@@ ators are calling for a degree of liqui@@ dity that is not there in the market 
 many money managers and some tra@@ ders had already left their offices early friday afternoon on a warm autumn day because the stock market was so quiet 
 then in a <@@ unk@@ > plun@@ ge the d@@ ow j@@ ones industri@@ als in barely an hour surren@@ dered about a third of their gains this year <@@ unk@@ > up a 19@@ 0.@@ 5@@ 8-@@ point or N N loss on the day in <@@ unk@@ > trading volume 
 <@@ unk@@ > trading accelerated to N million shares a record for the big board 
 at the end of the day N million shares were traded 
 the d@@ ow j@@ ones industri@@ als closed at N 
 the d@@ ow 's decline was second in point terms only to the <@@ unk@@ > black monday crash that occurred oc@@ t. N N 
 in percentage terms however the d@@ ow 's dive was the <@@ unk@@ > ever and the shar@@ pest since the market fell N or N N a week after black monday 
 the d@@ ow fell N N on black monday 
 shares of u@@ al the parent of united airlines were extremely active all day friday reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ N billion bu@@ y-@@ out of the airline by an <@@ unk@@ > group 
 wall street 's take@@ over-@@ stock specul@@ ators or risk arbit@@ ra@@ gers had placed unusually large be@@ ts that a take@@ over would succeed and u@@ al stock would rise 
 at N p.m. ed@@ t came the <@@ unk@@ > news the big board was <@@ unk@@ > trading in u@@ al pending news 
 on the exchange floor as soon as u@@ al stopped trading we <@@ unk@@ > for a panic said one top floor tra@@ der 
 several tra@@ ders could be seen shaking their heads when the news <@@ unk@@ > 
 for weeks the market had been nervous about take@@ overs after ca@@ m@@ pe@@ au cor@@ p. 's cash cr@@ unch sp@@ ur@@ red concern about the prospects for future highly le@@ ver@@ aged take@@ overs 
 and N minutes after the u@@ al trading halt came news that the u@@ al group could n't get financing for its bid 
 at this point the d@@ ow was down about N points 
 the market <@@ unk@@ > 
 arbit@@ ra@@ gers could n't dump their u@@ al stock but they rid themselves of nearly every rumor stock they had 
 for example their selling caused trading hal@@ ts to be declared in u@@ sa@@ ir group which closed down N N to N N del@@ ta air lines which fell N N to N N and <@@ unk@@ > industries which sank N to N N 
 these stocks eventually re@@ opened 
 but as panic spread specul@@ ators began to sell blue-@@ chip stocks such as phi@@ lip mor@@ ris and international business machines to offset their losses 
 when trading was hal@@ ted in phi@@ lip mor@@ ris the stock was trading at N down N N while i@@ b@@ m closed N N lower at N 
 selling <@@ unk@@ > because of waves of automatic stop@@ -@@ loss orders which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels 
 most of the stock selling pressure came from wall street professionals including computer-@@ guided program tra@@ ders 
 tra@@ ders said most of their major institu@@ tional investors on the other hand sat tight 
 now at N one of the market 's post-@@ crash reforms took hold as the s@@ &@@ p N futures contract had plun@@ ged N points equivalent to around a <@@ unk@@ > drop in the d@@ ow industri@@ als 
 under an agreement signed by the big board and the chic@@ ago mer@@ can@@ tile exchange trading was temporarily hal@@ ted in chic@@ ago 
 after the trading halt in the s@@ &@@ p N pit in chic@@ ago waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the big board and specialists continued to <@@ unk@@ > prices down 
 as a result the link between the futures and stock markets <@@ unk@@ > apart 
 without the <@@ unk@@ > of stoc@@ k-@@ index futures the bar@@ ometer of where tra@@ ders think the overall stock market is headed many tra@@ ders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the big board 
 the futures halt was even <@@ unk@@ > by big board floor tra@@ ders 
 it <@@ unk@@ > things up said one major specialist 
 this confusion effectively hal@@ ted one form of program trading stock index arbit@@ rage that closely links the futures and stock markets and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings 
 in a stoc@@ k-@@ index arbit@@ rage sell program tra@@ ders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference 
 when the airline information came through it <@@ unk@@ > every model we had for the market@@ place said a managing director at one of the largest progra@@ m-@@ trading firms 
 we did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do 
 but stocks kept falling 
 the d@@ ow industri@@ als were down N points at N p.m. before the <@@ unk@@ > halt 
 at N p.m. at the end of the cooling off period the average was down N points 
 meanwhile during the the s@@ &@@ p trading halt s@@ &@@ p futures sell orders began <@@ unk@@ > up while stocks in new y@@ ork kept falling sharply 
 big board chairman jo@@ hn j@@ . p@@ hel@@ an said yesterday the circuit breaker worked well <@@ unk@@ > 
 i just think it 's <@@ unk@@ > at this point to get into a debate if index arbit@@ rage would have helped or hurt things 
 under another post-@@ crash system big board president rich@@ ard <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . p@@ hel@@ an was flying to <@@ unk@@ > as the market was falling was talking on an <@@ unk@@ > hot line to the other exchanges the securi@@ ties and exchange commission and the federal reserve board 
 he <@@ unk@@ > out at a high-tech <@@ unk@@ > center on the floor of the big board where he could watch <@@ unk@@ > on prices and pending stock orders 
 at about N p.m. ed@@ t s@@ &@@ p futures resumed trading and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line 
 buyers stepped in to the futures pit 
 but the <@@ unk@@ > of s@@ &@@ p futures sell orders weighed on the market and the link with stocks began to fr@@ ay again 
 at about N the s@@ &@@ p market <@@ unk@@ > to still another limit of N points down and trading was locked again 
 futures tra@@ ders say the s@@ &@@ p was <@@ unk@@ > that the d@@ ow could fall as much as N points 
 during this time small investors began ringing their bro@@ kers wondering whether another crash had begun 
 at pr@@ ud@@ enti@@ al-@@ b@@ ache securi@@ ties inc@@ . which is trying to cater to small investors some <@@ unk@@ > bro@@ kers thought this would be the final <@@ unk@@ > 
 that 's when ge@@ or@@ ge l@@ . ball chairman of the pr@@ ud@@ ential insurance co@@ . of america unit took to the internal <@@ unk@@ > system to declare that the plun@@ ge was only mechanical 
 i have a <@@ unk@@ > that this particular decline today is something more <@@ unk@@ > about less 
 it would be my <@@ unk@@ > to advise clients not to sell to look for an opportunity to buy m@@ r@@ . ball told the bro@@ kers 
 at mer@@ ri@@ ll ly@@ n@@ ch & co@@ . the nation 's biggest bro@@ ker@@ age firm a news release was prepared <@@ unk@@ > mer@@ ri@@ ll ly@@ n@@ ch comments on market drop 
 the release cau@@ tioned that there are significant differences between the current environment and that of oc@@ to@@ ber N and that there are still attractive investment opportunities in the stock market 
 however je@@ ff@@ rey b@@ . lane president of sh@@ ear@@ son le@@ hman hu@@ tton inc@@ . said that friday 's plun@@ ge is going to set back relations with customers because it <@@ unk@@ > the concern of vo@@ la@@ ti@@ lity 
 and i think a lot of people will <@@ unk@@ > on program trading 
 it 's going to bring the debate right back to the <@@ unk@@ > 
 as the d@@ ow average ground to its final N loss friday the s@@ &@@ p pit stayed locked at its <@@ unk@@ > trading limit 
 je@@ ff@@ rey <@@ unk@@ > of program tra@@ der <@@ unk@@ > investment group said N s@@ &@@ p contracts were for sale on the close the equivalent of $ N million in stock 
 but there were no buyers 
 while friday 's deb@@ acle involved mainly professional tra@@ ders rather than investors it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning tra@@ ders said 
 stoc@@ k-@@ index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than inde@@ xes of the stock market itself 
 at those levels stocks are set up to be <@@ unk@@ > by index arbit@@ ra@@ gers who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall and simultaneously sell off stocks 
 but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today 
 the <@@ unk@@ > between the stock and futures markets friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether wall street is properly prepared for another crash situation 
 the big board 's m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said our <@@ unk@@ > performance was good 
 but the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks 
 obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the <@@ unk@@ > obligations were n't met he said 
 see related story fed ready to <@@ unk@@ > big funds w@@ s@@ j oc@@ t. N N 
 but specialists complain privately that just as in the N crash the <@@ unk@@ > firms big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock stayed on the side@@ lines during friday 's <@@ unk@@ > 
 m@@ r@@ . p@@ hel@@ an said it will take another day or two to analyze who was buying and selling friday

 ports of call inc@@ . reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that were n't disclosed 
 the agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring 
 the company said a portion of the $ N million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended <@@ unk@@ > operations 
 earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fle@@ et of bo@@ eing co@@ . <@@ unk@@ > because of increasing maintenance costs 
 a con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um of private investors operating as <@@ unk@@ > funding co@@ . said it has made a $ N million cash bid for most of l.@@ j@@ . hoo@@ ker cor@@ p. 's real-@@ estate and <@@ unk@@ > hol@@ dings 
 the $ N million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $ N million in secured li@@ abilities on those properties according to those making the bid 
 the group is led by j@@ ay <@@ unk@@ > chief executive officer of <@@ unk@@ > investment cor@@ p. in <@@ unk@@ > and a@@ . boy@@ d simp@@ son chief executive of the at@@ lan@@ ta@@ -based simp@@ son organization in@@ c 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 's company specializes in commercial real-@@ estate investment and claims to have $ N billion in assets m@@ r@@ . simp@@ son is a developer and a former senior executive of l.@@ j@@ . hoo@@ ker 
 the assets are good but they require more money and management than can be provided in l.@@ j@@ . hoo@@ ker 's current situation said m@@ r@@ . simp@@ son in an interview 
 hoo@@ ker 's philosophy was to build and sell 
 we want to build and hold 
 l.@@ j@@ . hoo@@ ker based in at@@ l@@ anta is operating with protection from its credi@@ tors under chapter N of the u@@ .s@@ . bankruptcy code 
 its parent company hoo@@ ker cor@@ p. of sy@@ dney austra@@ lia is currently being managed by a cour@@ t-@@ appointed pro@@ visi@@ onal <@@ unk@@ > 
 san@@ ford <@@ unk@@ > chief executive of l.@@ j@@ . hoo@@ ker said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the credi@@ tors committee 
 the $ N million bid is estimated by m@@ r@@ . simp@@ son as representing N N of the value of all hoo@@ ker real-@@ estate hol@@ dings in the u@@ .s@@ . 
 not included in the bid are <@@ unk@@ > teller or b@@ . al@@ t@@ man & co@@ . l.@@ j@@ . hoo@@ ker 's de@@ part@@ ment-@@ store chains 
 the offer covers the massive N <@@ unk@@ > forest fair mall in c@@ inc@@ in@@ na@@ ti the N <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > fashion mall in colu@@ mb@@ ia s.@@ c@@ . and the N <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > town center mall in <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ >

 the con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um was put together by <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > the lon@@ d@@ on-@@ based investment banking company that is a subsidiary of security p@@ acific cor@@ p 
 we do n't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid said <@@ unk@@ > camp@@ bell the head of mer@@ gers and acqui@@ si@@ tions at <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > in an interview 
 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > is acting as the con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um 's investment ban@@ kers 
 according to people familiar with the con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um the bid was <@@ unk@@ > project <@@ unk@@ > a reference to the film <@@ unk@@ > in which a <@@ unk@@ > played by actress <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > is saved from a <@@ unk@@ > businessman by a police officer named jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > 
 l.@@ j@@ . hoo@@ ker was a small <@@ unk@@ > company based in at@@ l@@ anta in N when m@@ r@@ . simp@@ son was hired to push it into commercial development 
 the company grew mode@@ stly until N when a majority position in hoo@@ ker cor@@ p. was acquired by austra@@ lian developer ge@@ or@@ ge <@@ unk@@ > currently hoo@@ ker 's chairman 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > to launch an ambitious but <@@ unk@@ > $ N billion acquisition bin@@ ge that included <@@ unk@@ > teller and b@@ . al@@ t@@ man & co@@ . as well as majority positions in mer@@ k@@ sa@@ mer jewel@@ ers a sac@@ ra@@ men@@ to chain <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . the <@@ unk@@ > retailer and <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . the southeast de@@ part@@ ment-@@ store chain 
 eventually m@@ r@@ . simp@@ son and m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > had a falling out over the direction of the company and m@@ r@@ . simp@@ son said he resigned in N 
 since then hoo@@ ker cor@@ p. has sold its interest in the <@@ unk@@ > chain back to <@@ unk@@ > 's management and is currently attempting to sell the b@@ . al@@ t@@ man & co@@ . chain 
 in addition ro@@ bert <@@ unk@@ > chief executive of the <@@ unk@@ > chain is seeking funds to buy out the hoo@@ ker interest in his company 
 the mer@@ k@@ sa@@ mer chain is currently being offered for sale by first bo@@ ston cor@@ p 
 reached in <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said that he believes the various hoo@@ ker <@@ unk@@ > can become profitable with new management 
 these are n't mature assets but they have the potential to be so said m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ >

 as small investors <@@ unk@@ > their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of with@@ draw@@ als cash 
 unlike the weekend before black monday the funds were n't <@@ unk@@ > with heavy withdrawal requests 
 and many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week 
 at fi@@ de@@ lity investments the nation 's largest fund company telephone volume was up sharply but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding black monday in N 
 the bo@@ ston firm said <@@ unk@@ > re@@ de@@ mptions were running at less than one-third the level two years ago 
 as of yesterday afternoon the re@@ de@@ mptions represented less than N N of the total cash position of about $ N billion of fi@@ de@@ lity 's stock funds 
 two years ago there were massive re@@ demption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around said c@@ . bru@@ ce <@@ unk@@ > who runs fi@@ de@@ lity investments ' $ N billion <@@ unk@@ > fund 
 this feels more like a <@@ unk@@ > deal 
 people are n't <@@ unk@@ > 
 the test may come today 
 friday 's stock market sel@@ l-@@ off came too late for many investors to act 
 some share@@ holders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices 
 stock fund re@@ de@@ mptions during the N deb@@ acle did n't begin to <@@ unk@@ > until after the market opened on black monday 
 but fund managers say they 're ready 
 many have raised cash levels which act as a buff@@ er against steep market decl@@ ines 
 mari@@ o <@@ unk@@ > for instance holds cash positions well above N N in several of his funds 
 wind@@ sor fund 's jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > and mutual series ' mic@@ ha@@ el price said they had raised their cash levels to more than N N and N N respectively this year 
 even pe@@ ter ly@@ n@@ ch manager of fi@@ de@@ lity 's $ N billion <@@ unk@@ > fund the nation 's largest stock fund built up cash to N N or $ N million 
 one reason is that after two years of monthly net re@@ de@@ mptions the fund posted net in@@ flows of money from investors in au@@ gust and september 
 i 've let the money build up m@@ r@@ . ly@@ n@@ ch said who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes 
 not all funds have raised cash levels of course 
 as a group stock funds held N N of assets in cash as of au@@ gust the latest figures available from the investment company institute 
 that was mode@@ stly higher than the N N and N N levels in au@@ gust and september of N 
 also persistent re@@ de@@ mptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash 
 but a strong level of invest@@ or with@@ draw@@ als is much more unlikely this time around fund managers said 
 a major reason is that investors already have sharply sc@@ aled back their purchases of stock funds since black monday 
 <@@ unk@@ > sales have re@@ b@@ ounded in recent months but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half N levels 
 there 's not nearly as much <@@ unk@@ > said jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > chairman of v@@ angu@@ ard group inc@@ . a big valley for@@ ge pa@@ . fund company 
 many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy 
 v@@ incent <@@ unk@@ > manager of the $ N billion well@@ ington fund added to his positions in bri@@ stol@@ -@@ my@@ ers squi@@ b@@ b w@@ ool@@ worth and d@@ un & bra@@ d@@ street friday 
 and today he 'll be looking to buy drug stocks like e@@ li li@@ lly p@@ fi@@ zer and american home products whose divi@@ d@@ end yiel@@ ds have been bol@@ stered by stock decl@@ ines 
 fi@@ de@@ lity 's m@@ r@@ . ly@@ n@@ ch for his part snapped up southern co@@ . shares friday after the stock got <@@ unk@@ > 
 if the market drops further today he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as bri@@ stol@@ -@@ my@@ ers and k@@ el@@ log@@ g 
 if they <@@ unk@@ > stocks like that he said it presents an opportunity that is the kind of thing you dream about 
 major mu@@ tu@@ al-@@ fund groups said phone calls were <@@ unk@@ > at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday 
 but most investors were seeking share prices and other information 
 trading volume was only mode@@ stly higher than normal 
 still fund groups are n't taking any chances 
 they hope to avoid the <@@ unk@@ > phone lines and other <@@ unk@@ > that <@@ unk@@ > some fund investors in oc@@ to@@ ber N 
 fi@@ de@@ lity on saturday opened its N <@@ unk@@ > invest@@ or centers across the country 
 the centers normally are closed through the weekend 
 in addition east coast centers will open at N ed@@ t this morning instead of the normal N 
 t. row@@ e price associates inc@@ . increased its staff of phone representatives to handle invest@@ or requests 
 the <@@ unk@@ > group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money@@ -@@ market funds 
 but most investors seemed to be in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode said st@@ even <@@ unk@@ > a vice president 
 and v@@ angu@@ ard among other groups said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through 
 in an unusual move several funds moved to calm investors with <@@ unk@@ > on their <@@ unk@@ > phone lines 
 we view friday 's market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors a recording at <@@ unk@@ > & co@@ . funds said over the weekend 
 the <@@ unk@@ > group had a similar recording for investors 
 several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabi@@ lize 
 some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits 
 stock funds have aver@@ aged a stag@@ g@@ ering gain of N N through september according to li@@ pper analytical services in@@ c 
 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > who runs sh@@ ear@@ son le@@ hman hu@@ tton inc@@ . 's $ N million sector analysis portfolio predic@@ ts the market will open down at least N points on technical factors and some panic selling 
 but she expects prices to re@@ bound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than N N to N N from recent high@@ s 
 this is not a major crash she said 
 nevertheless m@@ s. <@@ unk@@ > said she was <@@ unk@@ > with phone calls over the weekend from nervous share@@ holders 
 half of them are really scared and want to sell she said but i 'm trying to talk them out of it 
 she added if they all were bul@@ lish i 'd really be upset 
 the back@@ drop to friday 's slide was <@@ unk@@ > different from that of the oc@@ to@@ ber N crash fund managers argue 
 two years ago unlike today the dollar was weak interest rates were rising and the market was very <@@ unk@@ > they say 
 from the investors ' standpoint institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson by selling at the lows on black monday said step@@ hen bo@@ e@@ sel manager of the $ N million t. row@@ e price growth and income fund 
 this time i do n't think we 'll get a panic reaction 
 new@@ port cor@@ p. said it expects to report <@@ unk@@ > earnings of between N cents and N cents a share somewhat below analy@@ sts ' estimates of N cents to N cents 
 the maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said orders fell below expectations in recent months 
 a spo@@ kes@@ man added that sales in the current quarter will about equal the <@@ unk@@ > quarter 's figure when new@@ port reported net income of $ N million or N cents a share on $ N million in sales 
 <@@ unk@@ > from the strike by N mach@@ ini@@ sts union members against bo@@ eing co@@ . reached air carriers friday as america west airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of hou@@ ston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the se@@ attle jet maker 
 pe@@ ter <@@ unk@@ > vice president for planning at the pho@@ enix ari@@ z@@ . carrier said in an interview that the work <@@ unk@@ > at bo@@ eing now entering its 13th day has caused some tur@@ mo@@ il in our schedul@@ ing and that more than N passengers who were booked to fly out of hou@@ ston on america west would now be put on other airlines 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said bo@@ eing told america west that the N it was supposed to get this thursday would n't be delivered until no@@ v@@ . N the day after the airline had been planning to <@@ unk@@ > service at hou@@ ston with four daily flights including three <@@ unk@@ > to pho@@ enix and one <@@ unk@@ > to las ve@@ gas 
 now those routes are n't expected to begin until jan 
 bo@@ eing is also supposed to send to america west another N <@@ unk@@ > aircraft as well as a N by year 's end 
 those too are almost certain to arrive late 
 at this point no other america west flights including its new service at san ant@@ oni@@ o tex@@ as new@@ ar@@ k n.@@ j@@ . and <@@ unk@@ > cali@@ f@@ . have been affected by the delays in bo@@ eing deliver@@ ies 
 nevertheless the company 's reaction <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > effect that a huge manufacturer such as bo@@ eing can have on other parts of the economy 
 it also is sure to help the mach@@ ini@@ sts put added pressure on the company 
 i just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged <@@ unk@@ > tom baker president of mach@@ ini@@ sts ' district N said in an interview yesterday 
 i do n't think their customers would like it very much 
 america west though is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be 
 i figure that american and united probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fle@@ ets they might not miss one at all m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said 
 indeed a random check friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations 
 southwest airlines has a bo@@ eing N set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time 
 it 's so close to completion bo@@ eing 's told us there wo n't be a problem said a southwest spo@@ kes@@ man 
 a spo@@ kes@@ man for am@@ r cor@@ p. said bo@@ eing has assured american airlines it will deliver a N on time later this month 
 american is preparing to take delivery of another N in early dece@@ mber and N more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable 
 in se@@ attle a bo@@ eing spo@@ kes@@ man explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further dis@@ rup@@ tions might be triggered by the strike 
 meanwhile supervisors and <@@ unk@@ > employees have been trying to finish some N aircraft mostly N and N ju@@ mbo j@@ ets at the company 's <@@ unk@@ > wash@@ . plant that were all but completed before the <@@ unk@@ > 
 as of friday four had been delivered and a fifth plane a N was supposed to be <@@ unk@@ > out over the weekend to air china 
 no date has yet been set to get back to the bar@@ gaining table 
 we want to make sure they know what they want before they come back said dou@@ g ham@@ mond the federal medi@@ ator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began 
 the investment community for one has been anticipating a <@@ unk@@ > resolution 
 though bo@@ eing 's stock price was batter@@ ed along with the rest of the market friday it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders 
 the market has taken two views that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very <@@ unk@@ > for bo@@ eing in the long term said how@@ ard <@@ unk@@ > an analy@@ st at <@@ unk@@ > j@@ . la@@ wr@@ ence in@@ c 
 bo@@ eing 's shares fell $ N friday to close at $ N in compo@@ site trading on the new y@@ ork stock exchange 
 but m@@ r@@ . baker said he thinks the earliest a p@@ act could be struck would be the end of this month <@@ unk@@ > that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week 
 still he said it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer 
 i would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything 
 last week bo@@ eing chairman frank <@@ unk@@ > sent striking workers a letter saying that to my knowledge bo@@ eing 's offer represents the best overall three-@@ year contract of any major u@@ .s@@ . industrial firm in recent history 
 but m@@ r@@ . baker called the letter and the company 's offer of a N N wage increase over the life of the p@@ act plus bonuses very weak 
 he added that the company <@@ unk@@ > the union 's resolve and the workers ' <@@ unk@@ > with being forced to work many hours overtime 
 in separate developments talks have broken off between mach@@ ini@@ sts representatives at lo@@ ck@@ he@@ ed cor@@ p. and the <@@ unk@@ > cali@@ f@@ . a@@ ero@@ space company 
 the union is continuing to work through its expired contract however 
 it had planned a strike vote for next sunday but that has been pushed back in@@ definitely 
 united auto workers local N which represents N workers at bo@@ eing 's helicopter unit in de@@ law@@ are county pa@@ . said it agreed to extend its contract on a <@@ unk@@ > basis with a <@@ unk@@ > notification to cancel while it continues bar@@ gaining 
 the accor@@ d expired yesterday 
 and bo@@ eing on friday said it received an order from <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > for four model N <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > valued at a total of about $ N million

 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 's senior vice president finance said its <@@ unk@@ > can@@ a@@ dian utilities l@@ t@@ d. unit is reviewing <@@ unk@@ > projects in eastern canada and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere including bri@@ tain where the british government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from priv@@ ate-@@ sector suppliers as part of its pri@@ va@@ ti@@ zation program 
 the projects are big 
 they can be c@@ $ N billion plus m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said 
 but we would n't go into them alone and can@@ a@@ dian utilities ' equ@@ ity stake would be small he said 
 <@@ unk@@ > we 'd like to be the operator of the project and a modest equ@@ ity invest@@ or 
 our long suit is our proven ability to operate power plants he said 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > would n't offer <@@ unk@@ > regarding <@@ unk@@ > 's proposed british project but he said it would compete for customers with two huge british power generating companies that would be formed under the country 's plan to <@@ unk@@ > its massive water and electric utilities 
 bri@@ tain 's government plans to raise about # N billion $ N billion from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities beginning next month 
 the planned electric utility sale scheduled for next year is alone expected to raise # N billion making it the world 's largest public offering 
 under terms of the plan independent <@@ unk@@ > would be able to compete for N N of customers until N and for another N N between N and N 
 can@@ a@@ dian utilities had N revenue of c@@ $ N billion mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in al@@ ber@@ ta where the company serves about N customers 
 there seems to be a move around the world to <@@ unk@@ > the generation of electricity m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said and can@@ a@@ dian utilities hopes to capitalize on it 
 this is a real thr@@ ust on our utility side he said adding that can@@ a@@ dian utilities is also <@@ unk@@ > projects in <@@ unk@@ > countries though he would be specific 
 can@@ a@@ dian utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in bri@@ tain in anticipation of the pri@@ va@@ ti@@ zation program 
 we 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in eng@@ land said bru@@ ce <@@ unk@@ > vice president corporate strategy and corporate planning with en@@ ron cor@@ p. hou@@ ston a big natural gas producer and pi@@ pe@@ line operator 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said en@@ ron is considering building <@@ unk@@ > power plants in the u@@ .@@ k@@ . capable of producing about N <@@ unk@@ > of power at a cost of about $ N million to $ N million 
 pse inc@@ . said it expects to report third earnings of $ N million to $ N million or N cents to N cents a share 
 in the year-@@ ago quarter the designer and operator of <@@ unk@@ > and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $ N or four cents a share on revenue of about $ N million

 <@@ unk@@ > & broad home cor@@ p. said it formed a $ N million limited partnership subsidiary to buy land in cali@@ for@@ nia suitable for residential development 
 the partnership <@@ unk@@ > & broad land development venture limited partnership is a N joint venture with a trust created by institu@@ tional clients of <@@ unk@@ > advi@@ sory cor@@ p. a unit of <@@ unk@@ > financial cor@@ p. a real estate advi@@ sory management and development company with offices in chic@@ ago and bever@@ ly hills cali@@ f

 the land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received <@@ unk@@ > and other appro@@ vals required for development and part of <@@ unk@@ > & broad 's job will be to obtain such appro@@ vals 
 the partnership runs the risk that it may not get the appro@@ vals for development but in return it can buy land at whole@@ sale rather than retail prices which can result in si@@ zable savings said bru@@ ce <@@ unk@@ > president and chief executive officer of <@@ unk@@ > & broad 
 there are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash 
 typically developers option property and then once they get the administrative appro@@ vals they buy it said m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind 
 we usually operate in that conservative manner 
 by setting up the joint venture <@@ unk@@ > & broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land while avoiding the negative <@@ unk@@ > to its own balance sheet m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said 
 the company is putting up only N N of the capital although it is responsible for providing management planning and processing services to the joint venture 
 this is one of the best ways to assure a pi@@ pe@@ line of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said 
 when the price of pl@@ astics took off in N quantum chemical cor@@ p. went along for the ride 
 the timing of quantum 's chief executive officer jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > appeared to be nothing less than inspired because he had just increased quantum 's reliance on pl@@ astics 
 the company <@@ unk@@ > much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew <@@ unk@@ > in two years 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said of the boom it 's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks 
 but now prices have <@@ unk@@ > and quantum 's profit is <@@ unk@@ > 
 some securi@@ ties analy@@ sts are looking for no better than break@@ -@@ even results from the company for the third quarter compared with year-@@ earlier profit of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N million 
 the stock having lost nearly a quarter of its value since sep@@ t. N closed at $ N share down $ N in new y@@ ork stock exchange compo@@ site trading friday 
 to a degree quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity pl@@ astics that <@@ unk@@ > modern life 
 having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history these producers now see their prices ero@@ ding 
 pri@@ cing cycles to be sure are nothing new for pl@@ astics producers 
 and the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the <@@ unk@@ > period that is just behind them 
 we were all wonderful heroes last year says an executive at one of quantum 's competitors 
 now we 're at the bottom of the <@@ unk@@ > 
 at quantum which is based in new y@@ ork the trouble is ma@@ gni@@ fied by the company 's heavy <@@ unk@@ > on pl@@ astics 
 once known as national <@@ unk@@ > & chemical cor@@ p. the company <@@ unk@@ > the wine and spirits business and <@@ unk@@ > more of its resources into pl@@ astics after m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > took the chief executive 's job in N 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > N years old declined to be interviewed for this article but he has consistently argued that over the long ha@@ ul across both the <@@ unk@@ > and the <@@ unk@@ > of the pl@@ astics market quantum will <@@ unk@@ > through its new direction 
 quantum 's lot is mostly tied to poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e <@@ unk@@ > used to make garbage bags milk <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > toys and meat packaging among other items 
 in the u@@ .s@@ . poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e market quantum has claimed the largest share about N N 
 but its competitors including d@@ ow chemical co@@ . union car@@ bi@@ de cor@@ p. and several oil gi@@ ants have much broader business interests and so are better <@@ unk@@ > against price swings 
 when the price of poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e moves a mere penny a pound quantum 's annual profit <@@ unk@@ > by about N cents a share provided no other <@@ unk@@ > are changing 
 in recent months the price of poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e even more than that of other commodity pl@@ astics has taken a dive 
 ben@@ ch@@ mark grades which still sold for as much as N cents a pound last spring have ski@@ dded to between N cents and N cents 
 meanwhile the price of <@@ unk@@ > the chemical building block of poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e has n't dropped nearly so fast 
 that <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > quantum badly because its own plants cover only about half of its <@@ unk@@ > needs 
 by many accounts an early hint of a price r@@ out in the making came at the start of this year 
 china which had been putting in huge orders for poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e abruptly hal@@ ted them 
 <@@ unk@@ > that excess poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e would soon be <@@ unk@@ > around the world other buyers then bet that prices had pe@@ aked and so began to draw down invent@@ ories rather than order new product 
 ken@@ ne@@ th mit@@ che@@ ll director of d@@ ow 's poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e business says producers were surprised to learn how much invent@@ ories had s@@ welled throughout the distribution chain as prices <@@ unk@@ > up 
 people were even <@@ unk@@ > bags he says 
 now producers hope prices have hit bottom 
 they recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks 
 no one knows however whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to <@@ unk@@ > 
 one <@@ unk@@ > is ge@@ or@@ ge <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > analy@@ st at opp@@ en@@ he@@ imer & co@@ . and a bear on pl@@ astics stocks 
 no@@ ting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained he remarks some say oc@@ to@@ ber 
 some say nove@@ mber 
 i say N 
 he argues that efforts to firm up prices will be under@@ min@@ ed by producers ' plans to expand production capacity 
 a quick turn@@ around is crucial to quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy 
 the company is trying to carry out a three-@@ year $ N billion <@@ unk@@ > program started this year 
 at the same time its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $ N million largely because of debt taken on to pay a $ <@@ unk@@ > special divi@@ d@@ end earlier this year 
 quantum described the pa@@ yout at the time as a way for it to share the <@@ unk@@ > with its holders because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases 
 some analy@@ sts saw the payment as an effort also to <@@ unk@@ > take@@ over spe@@ culation 
 whether a cash cr@@ unch might eventually force the company to cut its quar@@ ter@@ ly divi@@ d@@ end raised N N to N cents a share only a year ago has become a topic of intense spe@@ culation on wall street since m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > divi@@ d@@ end questions in a sep@@ t. N meeting with analy@@ sts 
 some viewed his response that company directors review the divi@@ d@@ end regularly as nothing more than the standard line from executives 
 but others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual <@@ unk@@ > performance 
 in any case on the day of the meeting quantum 's shares slid $ N to $ N in big board trading 
 on top of everything else quantum <@@ unk@@ > a disaster at its plant in mor@@ ris ill 
 after an explosion <@@ unk@@ > the plant in j@@ une the company <@@ unk@@ > in september to within N hours of completing the <@@ unk@@ > process of <@@ unk@@ > it 
 then a second explosion occurred 
 two workers died and six remain in the hospital 
 this human toll adds the most painful <@@ unk@@ > yet to the sudden change in quantum 's fortunes 
 until this year the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up <@@ unk@@ > safety <@@ unk@@ > 
 a prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another <@@ unk@@ > into quantum 's financial future 
 when a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand <@@ unk@@ > lost profit and thus claims under <@@ unk@@ > insurance is <@@ unk@@ > 
 but the numbers become <@@ unk@@ > and subject to <@@ unk@@ > between in@@ sured and insur@@ er when demand is shifting 
 you say you could have sold x percent of this product and <@@ unk@@ > percent of that rec@@ alls <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > an analy@@ st at sh@@ ear@@ son le@@ hman hu@@ tton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer 
 and then you still have to negotiate 
 quantum hopes the mor@@ ris plant where limited production got under way last week will resume full operation by year 's end 
 the plant usually accounts for N N to N N of quantum 's poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e production and N N of its <@@ unk@@ > production 
 not everything looks gri@@ m for quantum 
 the plant expansion should strengthen the company 's <@@ unk@@ > in the poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e business where market share is often taken through sheer capacity 
 by lifting <@@ unk@@ > production the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs 
 quantum is also ti@@ ghten@@ ing its grip on its one large business outside chemicals prop@@ ane marketing 
 through a venture with its investment banker first bo@@ ston cor@@ p. quantum completed in au@@ gust an acquisition of <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . in a transaction valued at $ N billion 
 <@@ unk@@ > is the second-@@ largest prop@@ ane distribu@@ tor in the u@@ .s@@ . 
 the largest suburban prop@@ ane was already owned by quantum 
 still quantum has a crisis to get past right now 
 some analy@@ sts specul@@ ate the weak@@ ening stock may yet attract a suit@@ or 
 the name <@@ unk@@ > in rumors is british petroleum co@@ . which is looking to expand its poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e business in the u@@ .s@@ . 
 asked about a bid for quantum a <@@ unk@@ > spo@@ kes@@ man says we pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors and i think that falls in that category 
 r@@ j@@ r n@@ abi@@ sco inc@@ . is <@@ unk@@ > its division responsible for buying network advertising time just a month after moving N of the group 's N employees to new y@@ ork from at@@ l@@ anta 
 a spo@@ kes@@ man for the new y@@ or@@ k-@@ based food and tobacco giant taken private earlier this year in a $ N billion le@@ ver@@ aged bu@@ y-@@ out by ko@@ hl@@ berg k@@ ra@@ vis ro@@ ber@@ ts & co@@ . confirmed that it is <@@ unk@@ > down the r@@ j@@ r n@@ abi@@ sco broadcast unit and <@@ unk@@ > its N employees in a move to save money 
 the spo@@ kes@@ man said r@@ j@@ r is discussing its <@@ unk@@ > plans with its two main advertising firms <@@ unk@@ > kat@@ z and <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 we found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost said the spo@@ kes@@ man who declined to specify how much r@@ j@@ r spends on network television time 
 an executive close to the company said r@@ j@@ r is spending about $ N million on network television time this year down from roughly $ N million last year 
 the spo@@ kes@@ man said the broadcast unit will be <@@ unk@@ > dec@@ . N and the move wo n't affect r@@ j@@ r 's print radio and <@@ unk@@ > buying practices 
 the broadcast group had been based in new y@@ ork until a year ago when r@@ j@@ r 's previous management moved it to at@@ l@@ anta the company 's headquarters before this summer 
 one employee with the group said r@@ j@@ r moved N employees of the group back to new y@@ ork in september because there was supposed to be a future 
 he said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks woo@@ ing them from jobs with advertising agencies 
 the r@@ j@@ r spo@@ kes@@ man said the company moved the N employees to new y@@ ork last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' <@@ unk@@ > season

 the u@@ .s@@ . which is <@@ unk@@ > its <@@ unk@@ > quo@@ tas is <@@ unk@@ > a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industri@@ alized countries which have relatively <@@ unk@@ > steel industries 
 meanwhile the u@@ .s@@ . has negotiated a significant cut in japan 's steel quo@@ ta and made only a minor increase to the steel <@@ unk@@ > for the eur@@ op@@ ean community 
 bra@@ z@@ il similar to me@@ x@@ ico and south korea is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the u@@ .s@@ . market than it had under the previous five-@@ year steel quo@@ tas which expired sep@@ t. N 
 bra@@ z@@ il and ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the u@@ .s@@ . for the year ending oc@@ t. N N 
 in recent years u@@ .s@@ . ste@@ el@@ makers have supplied about N N of the N million tons of steel used annually by the nation 
 of the remaining N N needed the <@@ unk@@ > negotiations <@@ unk@@ > about N N to foreign suppliers with the difference supplied mainly by canada which is n't included in the quo@@ ta program 
 other countries that do n't have formal steel quo@@ tas with the u@@ .s@@ . such as tai@@ wan swe@@ den and ar@@ gent@@ ina also have supplied steel 
 some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the u@@ .s@@ . that are similar to quo@@ tas 
 the bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quo@@ tas known as voluntary restraint agreements until march N N 
 it also said it would use that <@@ unk@@ > year period to work toward an international consensus on <@@ unk@@ > up the international steel trade which has been <@@ unk@@ > managed subsidized and protected by governments 
 the u@@ .s@@ . ter@@ med its plan a trade <@@ unk@@ > program despite the fact that it is merely an extension 
 me@@ x@@ ico which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the u@@ .s@@ . virtually doubled its quo@@ ta to N N of the u@@ .s@@ . steel market from N N under the previous quo@@ tas 
 south korea which had N N under the previous quo@@ tas is set to get a small increase to about N N 
 that increase rises to slightly more than N N of the u@@ .s@@ . market if a joint <@@ unk@@ > steel project is included 
 meanwhile bra@@ z@@ il is expected to increase its allowance from the N N share it has had in recent years 
 the ec and japan the u@@ .s@@ . 's largest steel suppliers have n't been filling their quo@@ tas to the full extent 
 the ec steel industry which has been coping with strong eur@@ op@@ ean demand has been supplying about N N of the u@@ .s@@ . market compared with recent quo@@ tas of about N N 
 japan has been shipping steel to total about N N of the u@@ .s@@ . market compared with a quo@@ ta of N N 
 in the recent talks the ec had its quo@@ ta increased about N tons to N N of the u@@ .s@@ . market from N N in N 
 but its quo@@ ta has been as high as N N in N 
 japan however has agreed to cut its quo@@ ta to about N N from N N previously 
 japan the ec bra@@ z@@ il me@@ x@@ ico and south korea provide about N N of the steel imported to the u@@ .s@@ . under the quo@@ ta program 
 the balance is supplied by a host of smaller expor@@ ters such as austra@@ lia and ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela 
 the u@@ .s@@ . had about an extra N N of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quo@@ ta talks 
 that was essentially made up of a N N increase in the overall quo@@ ta program and N N from cutting japan 's allowance 
 negoti@@ ators from the white house trade office will repeat these quo@@ ta negotiations next year when they will have another N N of the u@@ .s@@ . steel market to <@@ unk@@ > 
 these <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > increases to the steel quo@@ ta program are built into the bush administration 's <@@ unk@@ > program to give its negoti@@ ators le@@ verage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and <@@ unk@@ > from their own steel industries 
 <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . expects fiscal second-@@ quarter earnings to trail N results but anticip@@ ates that several new products will lead to a much stronger performance in its second half 
 <@@ unk@@ > a tele@@ communications company had net income of $ N or five cents a share in its year-@@ earlier second quarter ended sep@@ t. N 
 revenue total@@ ed $ N million 
 ge@@ or@@ ge <@@ unk@@ > chairman and chief executive officer said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ N million 
 the lower results m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said reflect a 12-@@ month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones <@@ unk@@ > 's primary business 
 although m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year he said <@@ unk@@ > will also benefit from moving into other areas 
 <@@ unk@@ > among those is the company 's <@@ unk@@ > into the public fac@@ si@@ mile business m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said 
 within the next year <@@ unk@@ > expects to place N fax machines made by <@@ unk@@ > in japan in hotels municipal buildings <@@ unk@@ > and other public <@@ unk@@ > around the country 
 <@@ unk@@ > will provide a credi@@ t-@@ card reader for the machines to collect store and forward bil@@ ling data 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said <@@ unk@@ > should realize a minimum of $ N of <@@ unk@@ > net earnings for each machine each month 
 <@@ unk@@ > has also developed an automatic call <@@ unk@@ > that will make further use of the company 's system for <@@ unk@@ > and handling credi@@ t-@@ card calls and collect calls 
 automatic call process@@ ors will provide that system for virtually any telephone m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said not just phones produced by <@@ unk@@ > 
 the company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones which do n't accept coins for use in hotel <@@ unk@@ > office <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and similar <@@ unk@@ > 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > estimated that the process@@ ors and convenience phones would produce about $ N of <@@ unk@@ > net earnings for each machine each month

 the company said the plan was n't adopted in response to any known offers for <@@ unk@@ > a maker and marke@@ ter of hospital products

 proc@@ ter & gamble co@@ . plans to begin testing next month a <@@ unk@@ > detergent that will require only a few <@@ unk@@ > per <@@ unk@@ > 
 the move stems from <@@ unk@@ > learned in japan where local competitors have had <@@ unk@@ > success with concentrated <@@ unk@@ > 
 it also marks p@@ &@@ g 's growing concern that its japanese rivals such as <@@ unk@@ > cor@@ p. may bring their <@@ unk@@ > to the u@@ .s@@ . 
 the c@@ inc@@ in@@ na@@ ti consu@@ mer@@ -@@ products giant got clo@@ bb@@ ered two years ago in japan when <@@ unk@@ > introduced a powerful detergent called attack which quickly won a N N stake in the japanese markets 
 they do n't want to get caught again says one industry <@@ unk@@ > 
 retailers in pho@@ enix ari@@ z@@ . say p@@ &@@ g 's new <@@ unk@@ > detergent to be called <@@ unk@@ > with color guard will be on shelves in that market by early nove@@ mber 
 a p@@ &@@ g spo@@ kes@@ woman confirmed that ship@@ ments to pho@@ enix started late last month 
 she said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others 
 <@@ unk@@ > are n't entirely new for p@@ &@@ g 
 the company introduced a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > in japan after watching the success of attack 
 when attack hit the shelves in N p@@ &@@ g 's share of the japanese market fell to about N N from more than N N 
 with the help of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > p@@ &@@ g 's share is now estimated to be N N 
 while the japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products the true test for p@@ &@@ g will be in the $ N billion u@@ .s@@ . detergent market where growth is slow and <@@ unk@@ > have gained <@@ unk@@ > over <@@ unk@@ > 
 the company may have chosen to market the product under the <@@ unk@@ > name since it 's already expanded its <@@ unk@@ > tide into N different <@@ unk@@ > including this year 's big hit tide with <@@ unk@@ > 
 with <@@ unk@@ > however it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more many people tend to dump too much detergent into the <@@ unk@@ > machine <@@ unk@@ > that it takes a cup of <@@ unk@@ > to really clean the <@@ unk@@ > 
 in the early 1980s p@@ &@@ g tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the <@@ unk@@ > brand name that it markets in eur@@ ope 
 but the product which was n't as concentrated as the new <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > in a market test in den@@ ver and was dropped 
 p@@ &@@ g and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > in <@@ unk@@ > but they have n't sold well despite the convenience 
 but p@@ &@@ g con@@ tends the new <@@ unk@@ > is a unique formula that also offers an <@@ unk@@ > that prevents colors from <@@ unk@@ > 
 and retailers are expected to <@@ unk@@ > the product in part because it will take up less shelf space 
 when shelf space was cheap bigger was better says <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > an analy@@ st at sal@@ om@@ on <@@ unk@@ > 
 but with so many brands <@@ unk@@ > for space that 's no longer the case 
 if the new <@@ unk@@ > sells well the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own <@@ unk@@ > 
 then retailers will probably push the <@@ unk@@ > brands out altogether he says 
 competition is bound to get tougher if <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > a product like attack in the u@@ .s@@ . 
 to be sure <@@ unk@@ > would n't have an easy time taking u@@ .s@@ . market share away from the mighty p@@ &@@ g which has about N N of the market 
 <@@ unk@@ > officials previously have said they are interested in selling <@@ unk@@ > in the u@@ .s@@ . but so far the company has focused on acqui@@ si@@ tions such as last year 's purchase of and@@ re@@ w <@@ unk@@ > co@@ . a c@@ inc@@ in@@ na@@ ti <@@ unk@@ > maker 
 it also has a <@@ unk@@ > facility in cali@@ for@@ nia 
 some believe p@@ &@@ g 's interest in a <@@ unk@@ > detergent goes beyond the concern for the japanese 
 this is something p@@ &@@ g would do with or without <@@ unk@@ > says m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 
 with economic tension between the u@@ .s@@ . and japan wor@@ sening many japanese had feared last week 's visit from u@@ .s@@ . trade representative car@@ la hills 
 they expected a new <@@ unk@@ > of demands that japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the u@@ .s@@ . 
 instead they got a discussion of the need for the u@@ .s@@ . and japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view 
 m@@ r@@ s. hills ' first trip to japan as america 's chief trade negoti@@ ator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by commerce secretary ro@@ bert a@@ . mo@@ s@@ bac@@ her 
 m@@ r@@ . mo@@ s@@ bac@@ her called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese business practices that supposedly inhi@@ bit free trade 
 he said such results should be <@@ unk@@ > in dollars and cents in reducing the u@@ .s@@ . trade deficit with japan 
 but m@@ r@@ s. hills speaking at a breakfast meeting of the american chamber of commerce in japan on saturday stressed that the objective is not to get defini@@ tive action by spring or summer it is rather to have a blue@@ print for action 
 she added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment some small step to convince the american people and the japanese people that we 're moving in <@@ unk@@ > 
 how such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months 
 american and japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . mo@@ s@@ bac@@ her and m@@ r@@ s. hills 
 many called it simply a contrast in styles 
 but some saw it as a classic negotiating <@@ unk@@ > 
 others said the bush administration may feel the rhetor@@ ic on both sides is getting out of hand 
 and some said it reflected the growing debate in wash@@ ington over pursuing free trade with japan <@@ unk@@ > some kind of managed trade 
 asked to compare her visit to m@@ r@@ . mo@@ s@@ bac@@ her 's m@@ r@@ s. hills replied i did n't hear every word he spoke but as a general propo@@ sition i think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the bush administration 
 yet more than one american official who sat in with her during three days of talks with japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly <@@ unk@@ > 
 i think my line has been very consistent m@@ r@@ s. hills said at a news conference saturday afternoon 
 i am painted sometimes as <@@ unk@@ > perhaps because i have a <@@ unk@@ > list of statu@@ tes to implement 
 i do n't feel very <@@ unk@@ > 
 i do n't feel either hard or soft 
 i feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade 
 when she met the local press for the first time on friday m@@ r@@ s. hills firmly re@@ iter@@ ated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > three areas targeted under the <@@ unk@@ > N provision of the N trade bill 
 she <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > business practices that the u@@ .s@@ . government has identified 
 but her main thr@@ ust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition 
 she said the trade <@@ unk@@ > was mainly due to <@@ unk@@ > factors and should n't be <@@ unk@@ > by setting <@@ unk@@ > targets 
 at her news conference for japanese reporters one economics journalist <@@ unk@@ > up the japanese sense of relief 
 my impression was that you would be a scary old lady he said drawing a few nervous <@@ unk@@ > from his colleagues 
 but i am relieved to see that you are beautiful and <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > and a person of integrity 
 m@@ r@@ s. hills ' remarks did raise questions at least among some u@@ .s@@ . officials about what exactly her stance is on u@@ .s@@ . access to the japanese semiconduc@@ tor market 
 the u@@ .s@@ . share of the japanese market has been stuck around N N for years 
 many americ@@ ans have interpreted a N agreement as <@@ unk@@ > u@@ .s@@ . companies a N N share by N but the japanese have denied making any such promise

 traditional industries inc@@ . said it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter that ended j@@ une N and is seeking new financing 
 the seller of photo@@ graphic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives including seeking increases in its credit lines 
 traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and would n't say if it expects to show a profit for the year 
 in the year ended j@@ une N N traditional reported net income of $ N million or $ N a share 
 the company did n't break out its four@@ th-@@ quarter results 
 in the latest nine months net income was $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million 
 separately the company said it would file a delayed <@@ unk@@ > report with the securi@@ ties and exchange commission within approximately N days 
 it said the delay resulted from difficulties in <@@ unk@@ > its accounting of a sett@@ lement with the federal trade commission

 the oil industry 's <@@ unk@@ > profits could <@@ unk@@ > through the rest of the year 
 major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profit@@ ability 
 the gasoline picture may improve this quarter but chemicals are likely to remain weak industry executives and analy@@ sts say reducing chances that profits could equal their year-@@ earlier performance 
 the industry is seeing a sof@@ tening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petro@@ chemicals gl@@ en@@ n co@@ x president of phi@@ lli@@ ps petroleum co@@ . said in an interview 
 that change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general he added 
 he did n't forecast phi@@ lli@@ ps 's results 
 but securi@@ ties analy@@ sts say phi@@ lli@@ ps will be among the companies <@@ unk@@ > by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-@@ quarter earnings 
 so too many analy@@ sts predict will ex@@ x@@ on cor@@ p. ch@@ ev@@ ron cor@@ p. and a@@ mo@@ co cor@@ p 
 typical is what happened to the price of <@@ unk@@ > a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies 
 it has plun@@ ged N N since july to around N cents a pound 
 a year ago <@@ unk@@ > sold for N cents <@@ unk@@ > at about N cents last dece@@ mber 
 a big reason for the chemical price retreat is <@@ unk@@ > 
 beginning in <@@ unk@@ > prices began acceler@@ ating as a growing u@@ .s@@ . economy and the weak dollar sp@@ ur@@ red demand 
 companies added capacity <@@ unk@@ > 
 now greatly increased supplies are on the market while the dollar is stronger and domestic economic growth is slower 
 third-@@ quarter profits from gasoline were weaker 
 refin@@ ing mar@@ gins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year said wi@@ lli@@ am <@@ unk@@ > a securi@@ ties analy@@ st at first bo@@ ston cor@@ p 
 oil company refin@@ eries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in july and au@@ gust that did n't <@@ unk@@ > 
 the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period 
 in addition crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier further <@@ unk@@ > profit@@ ability 
 refin@@ ers say mar@@ gins picked up in september and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will re@@ bound this quarter though still not to the level of N 's fourth quarter 
 during the N second half many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits 
 crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year 
 prices aver@@ aging roughly $ N a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier have stayed well above most companies ' expectations 
 demand has been much stronger than anticipated and it typically <@@ unk@@ > in the fourth quarter 
 we could see higher oil prices this year said <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > an analy@@ st at pain@@ e@@ web@@ ber in@@ c 
 that will translate into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ N a barrel in the fourth quarter 
 while oil prices have been better than expected natural gas prices have been worse 
 in the third quarter they aver@@ aged about N N less than they were in N 
 the main reason remains weather 
 last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to <@@ unk@@ > more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air <@@ unk@@ > use 
 this summer on the other hand had <@@ unk@@ > weather than usual 
 we 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices said m@@ r@@ . co@@ x phi@@ lli@@ ps 's president 
 the lag@@ ging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected 
 going into the fourth quarter natural gas prices are anywhere from N N to N N lower than a year earlier 
 for instance natural gas currently produced along the gul@@ f coast is selling on the spot market for around $ N a thousand cub@@ ic feet down N N from $ N a thousand cub@@ ic feet a year ago 
 the bush administration trying to blunt growing demands from western eur@@ ope for a <@@ unk@@ > of controls on exports to the so@@ viet blo@@ c is questioning whether it@@ aly 's <@@ unk@@ > c@@ . oli@@ ve@@ t@@ ti & co@@ . supplied <@@ unk@@ > valuable technology to the so@@ vi@@ ets 
 most of the western eur@@ op@@ ean members of <@@ unk@@ > committee on <@@ unk@@ > export controls the <@@ unk@@ > forum through which the u@@ .s@@ . and its al@@ lies <@@ unk@@ > their <@@ unk@@ > policies are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in par@@ is oc@@ t. N and N 
 they plan to press specifically for a <@@ unk@@ > of rules governing exports of machine tools computers and other high-@@ technology products 
 but the bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all co@@ com members are <@@ unk@@ > fully with existing <@@ unk@@ > procedures before it will support further <@@ unk@@ > 
 to make its point it is challenging the italian government to explain reports that oli@@ ve@@ t@@ ti may have supplied the so@@ viet union with sophisticated computer-@@ driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft 
 the london sunday times which first reported the u@@ .s@@ . concerns cited a u@@ .s@@ . intelligence report as the source of the alle@@ gations that oli@@ ve@@ t@@ ti exported $ N million in <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > flexible manufacturing systems to the so@@ viet aviation industry 
 oli@@ ve@@ t@@ ti reportedly began shipping these tools in N 
 a state department spo@@ kes@@ man acknowledged that the u@@ .s@@ . is discussing the alle@@ gations with the italian government and co@@ com but declined to confirm any details 
 italian president <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > promised a quick investigation into whether oli@@ ve@@ t@@ ti broke co@@ com rules 
 president bush called his attention to the matter during the italian leader 's visit here last week 
 oli@@ ve@@ t@@ ti has denied that it violated co@@ com rules <@@ unk@@ > that the reported ship@@ ments were properly licensed by the italian authorities 
 although the <@@ unk@@ > of these sales is still an open question the disclosure could n't be better <@@ unk@@ > to support the position of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > in the p@@ ent@@ agon and the intelligence community 
 it seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important co@@ com meeting said a wash@@ ington lob@@ by@@ ist for a number of u@@ .s@@ . computer companies 
 the bush administration has sent <@@ unk@@ > signals about its <@@ unk@@ > policies reflecting <@@ unk@@ > divisions among several competing agencies 
 last summer m@@ r@@ . bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual <@@ unk@@ > when he told a north at@@ lantic treat@@ y organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the co@@ com <@@ unk@@ > of strategic goods 
 but more recently the p@@ ent@@ agon and the commerce department openly <@@ unk@@ > over the extent to which co@@ com should <@@ unk@@ > exports of personal computers to the blo@@ c 
 however these agencies generally agree that the west should be cautious about any further <@@ unk@@ > 
 there 's no evidence that the so@@ viet program to illegally acquire western technology has dimini@@ shed said a state department spo@@ kes@@ man

 <@@ unk@@ > hotels was controlled by m@@ r@@ . bo@@ es@@ ky who currently is serving a prison term for securi@@ ties vio@@ lations

 shortly before the visit m@@ r@@ . bo@@ es@@ ky and dre@@ x@@ el <@@ unk@@ > had met with financial cor@@ p. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the N N stake in the company

 while corn and soybean prices have slu@@ mped well below their <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > of N wheat prices remain <@@ unk@@ > high 
 and they 're likely to stay that way for months to come analy@@ sts say 
 for one thing even with many farmers <@@ unk@@ > more winter wheat this year than last tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into N the analy@@ sts say 
 and if rain does n't fall soon across many of the great pla@@ ins ' <@@ unk@@ > areas yiel@@ ds in the crop now being planted could be reduced further <@@ unk@@ > supplies 
 also supporting prices are expectations that the so@@ viet union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months 
 by next may N stocks of u@@ .s@@ . wheat to be carried over into the next season before the winter wheat now being planted is <@@ unk@@ > are projected to drop to N million <@@ unk@@ > 
 that would be the lowest level since the early 1970s 
 stocks were N million <@@ unk@@ > on may N of this year 
 in response to <@@ unk@@ > domestic supplies agriculture secretary <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > last month said the u@@ .s@@ . government would slightly increase the number of ac@@ res farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments 
 the government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about N million <@@ unk@@ > 
 it now estimates production for next year at just under N billion <@@ unk@@ > compared with this year 's estimated N billion and a <@@ unk@@ > N billion in N 
 but the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year 
 until then limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ <@@ unk@@ > level analy@@ sts say 
 on the chic@@ ago board of trade friday wheat for dece@@ mber delivery settled at $ N a bu@@ sh@@ el unchanged 
 in theory at least tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a <@@ unk@@ > squeeze said d@@ ani@@ el <@@ unk@@ > a futures analy@@ st with <@@ unk@@ > co@@ . in chic@@ ago 
 such a situation can <@@ unk@@ > ha@@ voc as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the chic@@ ago board of trade 
 in july the <@@ unk@@ > ordered <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > s.@@ p a@@ . to liqui@@ date futures positions equal to about N million <@@ unk@@ > of soybeans 
 the exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their <@@ unk@@ > obligation to the italian con@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ate which had refused requests to reduce its hol@@ dings 
 <@@ unk@@ > has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market 
 <@@ unk@@ > hot dry weather across large portions of the great pla@@ ins and in <@@ unk@@ > areas in wash@@ ington and ore@@ gon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop said <@@ unk@@ > le@@ sli@@ e a futures analy@@ st and head of le@@ sli@@ e analytical in chic@@ ago 
 for example in the ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a <@@ unk@@ > N N or more of the <@@ unk@@ > is short of <@@ unk@@ > 
 that figure <@@ unk@@ > to about N N in <@@ unk@@ > portions of kan@@ sas he said 
 the so@@ viet union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans but many analy@@ sts expect mo@@ scow to place si@@ zable orders for u@@ .s@@ . wheat in the next few months further supporting prices

 late thursday after the close of trading the market received what would normally have been a bul@@ lish u@@ .s@@ . department of agriculture estimate of the N fl@@ ori@@ da orange crop 
 it was near the low range of estimates at N million <@@ unk@@ > boxes compared with N million boxes last season 
 however as expected bra@@ z@@ il waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its <@@ unk@@ > concentrate to about $ N a pound from around $ N 
 friday 's <@@ unk@@ > selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the u@@ .s@@ . report might have had and sent the nove@@ mber orange <@@ unk@@ > contract down as much as N cents a pound at one time 
 it settled with a loss of N cents at $ N a pound 
 bra@@ zi@@ lian <@@ unk@@ > after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season is beginning to arrive in the u@@ .s@@ . in large quantities 
 bra@@ z@@ il wants to stimulate demand for its product which is going to be in <@@ unk@@ > supply 
 the price cut one analy@@ st said appeared to be aimed even more at eur@@ ope where consumption of bra@@ zi@@ lian <@@ unk@@ > has fallen 
 it 's a <@@ unk@@ > product and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in eur@@ ope the analy@@ st said

 although some analy@@ sts look for prof@@ it-@@ taking in the wake of friday 's leap in crude oil prices last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week

 there has been little news to account for such <@@ unk@@ > in the oil markets

 m@@ r@@ . spi@@ el@@ vo@@ gel is n't part of the board nor are any of the other heads of sa@@ at@@ chi 's big <@@ unk@@ > ad agencies

 newspaper publishers are reporting mixed third-@@ quarter results ai@@ ded by favorable newsp@@ r@@ int prices and hamp@@ ered by flat or declining advertising <@@ unk@@ > especially in the northeast 
 adding to <@@ unk@@ > in the industry seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general <@@ unk@@ > within the retail industry 
 in new y@@ ork the <@@ unk@@ > teller and b@@ . al@@ t@@ man & co@@ . department stores have filed for protection from credi@@ tors under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code while the r.@@ h@@ . macy & co@@ . bloom@@ ing@@ d@@ ale 's and sa@@ ks fifth avenue de@@ part@@ ment-@@ store chains are for sale 
 many papers throughout the country are also faced with a slow@@ down in <@@ unk@@ > spending a booming category for newspapers in recent years 
 until recently industry analy@@ sts believed <@@ unk@@ > in retail ad spending had <@@ unk@@ > out and would in fact increase in this year 's third and fourth quarters 
 all be@@ ts are off analy@@ sts say because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains 
 improved paper prices will help offset weakness in <@@ unk@@ > but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad <@@ unk@@ > they usually run said ed@@ ward j@@ . <@@ unk@@ > industry analy@@ st for sal@@ om@@ on brothers in@@ c 
 retailers are just in dis@@ arr@@ ay 
 for instance <@@ unk@@ > co@@ . posted an N N gain in net income as total ad pages dropped at usa today but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates 
 <@@ unk@@ > 's N daily and N <@@ unk@@ > newspapers reported a N N increase in advertising and circulation revenue 
 total advertising <@@ unk@@ > was mode@@ stly lower as <@@ unk@@ > volume increased while there was softer demand for retail and national ad <@@ unk@@ > said jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 's chief executive officer 
 at usa today ad pages total@@ ed N for the quarter down N N from the N period which was helped by increased ad spending from the summer olymp@@ ics 
 while usa today 's total paid ad pages for the year to date total@@ ed N a decrease of N N from last year the paper 's ad revenue increased N N in the quarter and N N in the nine months 
 in the nine months <@@ unk@@ > 's net rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share

 at d@@ ow j@@ ones & co@@ . third-@@ quarter net income fell N N from the year-@@ earlier period 
 net fell to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share 
 the year-@@ earlier period included a one-@@ time gain of $ N million or four cents a share 
 revenue gained N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the drop in profit reflected in part continued sof@@ tness in financial advertising at the wall street journal and bar@@ ron 's magazine 
 ad <@@ unk@@ > at the journal fell N N in the third quarter 
 affiliated publi@@ cations inc@@ . reversed a year-@@ earlier third quarter net loss 
 the publisher of the bo@@ ston globe reported net of $ N million or N cents a share compared with a loss of $ N million or N cents a share for the third quarter in N 
 wi@@ lli@@ am o@@ . ta@@ yl@@ or the parent 's chairman and chief executive officer said earnings continued to be hurt by sof@@ tness in ad volume at the bo@@ ston newspaper 
 third-@@ quarter profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected by the price of newsp@@ r@@ int which in the last two years has had several price increases 
 after a supply cr@@ unch caused prices to rise N N since N to $ N a me@@ tri@@ c ton analy@@ sts are encouraged because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of this year 
 companies with daily newspapers in the northeast will need the stable newsp@@ r@@ int prices to ease damage from weak ad <@@ unk@@ > 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > at sal@@ om@@ on brothers said he estimates that times mirror co@@ . 's earnings were down for the third quarter because of soft advertising levels at its long island <@@ unk@@ > and har@@ t@@ ford <@@ unk@@ > newspapers 
 trouble on the east coast was likely offset by improved ad <@@ unk@@ > at the los angel@@ es times which this week also un@@ veiled a <@@ unk@@ > 
 new y@@ ork times co@@ . is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its fl@@ ag@@ ship new y@@ ork times and deep dis@@ counting of newsp@@ r@@ int at its affili@@ ate forest products group 
 times co@@ . 's regional daily newspapers are holding up well but there is little sign that things will improve in the new y@@ ork market said al@@ an <@@ unk@@ > an analy@@ st with sh@@ ear@@ son le@@ hman hu@@ tton 
 wash@@ ington post co@@ . is expected to report improved earnings largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the wash@@ ington area 
 according to analy@@ sts profits were also helped by successful cost-@@ cutting measures at news@@ week 
 the <@@ unk@@ > has faced he@@ igh@@ tened competition from rival time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market 
 k@@ night-@@ rid@@ der inc@@ . is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its de@@ tro@@ it free press and <@@ unk@@ > 's de@@ tro@@ it news and has told analy@@ sts that earnings were down in the third quarter 
 however analy@@ sts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers such as the mi@@ ami her@@ ald and san jo@@ se mer@@ cur@@ y news 
 the mi@@ ami market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years when k@@ night-@@ rid@@ der was starting up a hi@@ sp@@ anic edition and circulation was falling said bru@@ ce <@@ unk@@ > an analy@@ st for <@@ unk@@ > national bank 
 general motors cor@@ p. in a series of moves that ang@@ ered union officials in the u@@ .s@@ . and canada has sign@@ aled that as many as five north american assembly plants may not survive the mid-@@ 1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess <@@ unk@@ > capacity 
 in announcements to workers late last week g@@ m effectively signed death <@@ unk@@ > for two <@@ unk@@ > van assembly plants and cast serious doubt on the futures of three u@@ .s@@ . car factories 
 g@@ m is under intense pressure to close factories that became un@@ profitable as the giant auto maker 's u@@ .s@@ . market share ski@@ dded during the past decade 
 the company currently using about N N of its north american vehicle capacity has v@@ owed it will run at N N of capacity by N 
 just a month ago g@@ m announced it would make an aging assembly plant in <@@ unk@@ > ga@@ . the eighth u@@ .s@@ . assembly facility to close since N 
 now g@@ m appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory con@@ soli@@ dation to get in shape for the 1990s 
 one reason is moun@@ ting competition from new japanese car plants in the u@@ .s@@ . that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than g@@ m can match 
 another is that united auto workers union officials have sign@@ aled they want ti@@ ghter <@@ unk@@ > pro@@ visions in the new big three national contract that will be negotiated next year 
 g@@ m officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin 
 the problem however is that g@@ m 's moves are coming at a time when <@@ unk@@ > leaders are trying to <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > who charge the union is too passive in the face of g@@ m lay@@ offs 
 against that back@@ drop <@@ unk@@ > vice president step@@ hen p. <@@ unk@@ > who recently became head of the union 's g@@ m department issued a statement friday <@@ unk@@ > g@@ m 's <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > toward union members 
 the auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest <@@ unk@@ > and product <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > out in separate <@@ unk@@ > to the affected plants showed dis@@ arr@@ ay and an inability or <@@ unk@@ > to provide consistent information m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said 
 g@@ m officials told workers late last week of the following moves production of <@@ unk@@ > v@@ ans will be con@@ soli@@ dated into a single plant in <@@ unk@@ > m@@ ich 
 that means two plants one in <@@ unk@@ > on@@ tari@@ o and the other in <@@ unk@@ > o@@ hi@@ o probably will be shut down after the end of N 
 the <@@ unk@@ > will idle about N can@@ a@@ dian assembly workers and about N workers in o@@ hi@@ o 
 ro@@ bert white can@@ a@@ dian auto workers union president used the imp@@ ending <@@ unk@@ > shutdown to <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > free trade agreement and its champion prime minister bri@@ an <@@ unk@@ >

 workers at plants in van <@@ unk@@ > cali@@ f@@ . ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a city and <@@ unk@@ > mic@@ h@@ . were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and ch@@ ev@@ ro@@ let <@@ unk@@ > muscle cars 
 g@@ m is studying whether it can build the new <@@ unk@@ > profit@@ ably at a plant in st@@ . <@@ unk@@ > que@@ bec company and union officials said 
 that announcement left union officials in van <@@ unk@@ > and ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a city uncertain about their futures 
 the van <@@ unk@@ > plant which emplo@@ ys about N workers does n't have a product to build after N 
 j@@ erry <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > local president said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a <@@ unk@@ > plant which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand 
 at the ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a city plant which emplo@@ ys about N workers building the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > cars ste@@ ve <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > local vice president said the plant has no new product lined up and none of us knows when the <@@ unk@@ > cars will die 
 he said he believes g@@ m has plans to keep building <@@ unk@@ > cars into the mid-@@ 1990s 
 at <@@ unk@@ > however the <@@ unk@@ > decision appears to <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > hopes that g@@ m would re@@ open the <@@ unk@@ > assembly plant that last built the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > model 
 the <@@ unk@@ > plant was viewed as a model of <@@ unk@@ > cooperation at g@@ m before slow sales of the <@@ unk@@ > forced the company to close the factory last year 
 union officials have taken a beating politically as a result 
 dissi@@ dent <@@ unk@@ > members have used the <@@ unk@@ > plant as a symbol of labor@@ -@@ management cooperation 's failure 
 <@@ unk@@ > mer@@ i@@ eu@@ x s.@@ a@@ . of fr@@ ance said the can@@ a@@ dian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of con@@ na@@ ught <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . for N million can@@ a@@ dian dollars us@@ $ N million 
 mer@@ i@@ eu@@ x said the government 's minister of industry science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of net benefit to canada 
 can@@ a@@ dian investment rules require that big foreign take@@ overs meet that standard 
 the french company said the government gave it N days in which to submit information to further support its take@@ over plan 
 both mer@@ i@@ eu@@ x and con@@ na@@ ught are bio@@ technology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns 
 the government 's action was unusual 
 al@@ an <@@ unk@@ > executive vice president of investment canada which over@@ sees foreign take@@ overs said it marked the first time in its four-@@ year history that the agency has made an adverse <@@ unk@@ > decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company 
 he said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns but eventually allowed those acqui@@ si@@ tions to proceed 
 this is n't a change in government policy this provision has been used before said <@@ unk@@ > red@@ mond press secretary for <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > canada 's minister of industry science and technology 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > issued the ruling based on a recommendation by investment canada 
 spo@@ kes@@ men for mer@@ i@@ eu@@ x and con@@ na@@ ught said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or investment canada but added they hope to have more information early this week 
 investment canada declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision 
 <@@ unk@@ > me@@ ht@@ a a partner with me@@ ht@@ a & <@@ unk@@ > a new y@@ or@@ k-@@ based pharmaceutical industry research firm said the government 's ruling was n't unexpected 
 this has become a very <@@ unk@@ > deal concerning canada 's only large <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > or pharmaceutical company m@@ r@@ . me@@ ht@@ a said 
 m@@ r@@ . me@@ ht@@ a said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an <@@ unk@@ > sett@@ lement of con@@ na@@ ught 's dispute with the university of tor@@ onto 
 the university is seeking to block the acquisition of con@@ na@@ ught by foreign interests c@@ iting concerns about the amount of research that would be done in canada 
 the university is considering a sett@@ lement proposal made by con@@ na@@ ught 
 while neither side will disclose its <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . me@@ ht@@ a expects it to contain more specific guaran@@ tees on research and development spending levels in canada than mer@@ i@@ eu@@ x offered to investment canada 
 some analy@@ sts such as mur@@ ray <@@ unk@@ > of tor@@ on@@ to-@@ based <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bi@@ dd@@ ers such as swi@@ t@@ zerland 's ci@@ ba-@@ gei@@ gy and ch@@ iron cor@@ p. of <@@ unk@@ > cali@@ f

 <@@ unk@@ > international inc@@ . said it canceled plans for a <@@ unk@@ > swa@@ p but may resume payment of divi@@ d@@ ends on the stock and added that it expects to publicly offer about N million common shares 
 the company said it planned to offer an <@@ unk@@ > number of common shares in exchange for the N shares of its preferred stock outstanding 
 the exchange ratio was never established

 additionally the company said it filed with the securi@@ ties and exchange commission for the proposed offering of N million shares of common stock expected to be offered in nove@@ mber

 earnings for most of the nation 's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead <@@ unk@@ > in the third quarter as companies with newer <@@ unk@@ > prescription drugs f@@ ared especially well 
 for the third consecutive quarter however most of the companies ' reven@@ ues were batter@@ ed by adverse foreign-@@ currency <@@ unk@@ > as a result of the strong dollar abroad 
 analy@@ sts said that mer@@ ck & co@@ . e@@ li li@@ lly & co@@ . war@@ ner@@ -@@ la@@ mb@@ ert co@@ . and the squi@@ b@@ b cor@@ p. unit of bri@@ stol@@ -@@ my@@ ers squi@@ b@@ b co@@ . all benefited from strong sales of relatively new <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > that provide wide profit mar@@ gins 
 less robust earnings at p@@ fi@@ zer inc@@ . and up@@ jo@@ hn co@@ . were attributed to those companies ' older products many of which face <@@ unk@@ > competition from generic drugs and other <@@ unk@@ > 
 jo@@ seph <@@ unk@@ > an analy@@ st with bear st@@ earns & co@@ . said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their <@@ unk@@ > businesses and institu@@ ted other cost savings such as con@@ soli@@ dating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs 
 as a result major new products are having significant impact even on a company with very large reven@@ ues m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said 
 analy@@ sts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers as a group is estimated to have climbed between N N and N N 
 while that 's not spectacular ne@@ il <@@ unk@@ > an analy@@ st with pr@@ ud@@ ential <@@ unk@@ > said that the rate of growth will look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns down@@ ward 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > estimated that mer@@ ck 's profit for the quarter rose by about N N prop@@ elled by sales of its <@@ unk@@ > of fast-@@ growing prescription drugs including its <@@ unk@@ > drug <@@ unk@@ > a high blood pressure medicine <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > an <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > an <@@ unk@@ > medication 
 profit climbed even though mer@@ ck 's sales were reduced by one to three percentage points as a result of the strong dollar m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said 
 in the third quarter of N mer@@ ck earned $ N million or N cents a share 
 in <@@ unk@@ > n.@@ j@@ . a mer@@ ck spo@@ kes@@ man said the company does n't make earnings projec@@ tions 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said he estimated that li@@ lly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about N N largely because of the performance of its new <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 the drug introduced last year is expected to generate sales of about $ N million this year

 several analy@@ sts said they expected war@@ ner@@ -@@ la@@ mb@@ ert 's profit also to increase by more than N N from $ N million or $ N a share it reported in the like period last year 
 the company is praised by analy@@ sts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit mar@@ gins 
 the company 's lean operation analy@@ sts said allowed <@@ unk@@ > sales from its cholesterol drug <@@ unk@@ > to power earnings growth

 squi@@ b@@ b 's profit estimated by analy@@ sts to be about N N above the $ N million or $ N a share it earned in the third quarter of N was the result of especially strong sales of its <@@ unk@@ > drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease 
 the company was officially merged with bri@@ stol@@ -@@ my@@ ers co@@ . earlier this month 
 bri@@ stol@@ -@@ my@@ ers declined to comment 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > of bear st@@ earns said that sch@@ er@@ ing-@@ pl@@ ough cor@@ p. 's expected profit rise of about N N to N N and <@@ unk@@ > 's expected profit increase of about N N are largely because those companies are really managed well

 in ma@@ di@@ son n.@@ j@@ . a spo@@ kes@@ man for sch@@ er@@ ing-@@ pl@@ ough said the company has no problems with the average estimate by a analy@@ sts that third-@@ quarter earnings per share rose by about N N to $ N 
 the company expects to achieve the N N increase in full-@@ year earnings per share as it projected in the spring the spo@@ kes@@ man said 
 meanwhile analy@@ sts said p@@ fi@@ zer 's recent string of l@@ ack@@ lu@@ ster quar@@ ter@@ ly performances continued as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about N N 
 sales of p@@ fi@@ zer 's important drugs <@@ unk@@ > for treating <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > a heart medicine have <@@ unk@@ > because of increased competition 
 the strong dollar hurt p@@ fi@@ zer a lot too m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said

 in new y@@ ork the company declined comment 
 analy@@ sts said they expected up@@ jo@@ hn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about N N to N N as compared with $ N million or N cents a share it earned a year ago 
 up@@ jo@@ hn 's <@@ unk@@ > drugs are <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > 
 sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restri@@ cting the <@@ unk@@ > of certain <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs 
 also the company 's <@@ unk@@ > drug <@@ unk@@ > is selling well at about $ N million for the year but the company 's profit from the drug has been reduced by up@@ jo@@ hn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising analy@@ sts said 
 in <@@ unk@@ > mic@@ h@@ . up@@ jo@@ hn declined comment 
 amid a crowd of <@@ unk@@ > stocks <@@ unk@@ > technology inc@@ . 's stock fell particularly hard friday dropping N N because its problems were comp@@ ounded by disclosure of an unexpected loss for its fiscal first quarter

 gul@@ f resources added that it will seek to recover equ@@ itable contribution from others for both the amount of the sett@@ lement and any other li@@ abilities it may incur under the super@@ fund law 
 under the agreement gul@@ f must give the u@@ .s@@ . government N days ' advance written notice before issu@@ ing any divi@@ d@@ ends on common stock

 many of the nation 's <@@ unk@@ > executives <@@ unk@@ > friday 's market plun@@ ge as an over@@ due <@@ unk@@ > for specul@@ ators and take@@ over players 
 assuming that the market does n't head into a <@@ unk@@ > free fall some executives think friday 's action could prove a <@@ unk@@ > of good news as a sign that the le@@ ver@@ aged bu@@ y-@@ out and take@@ over fr@@ en@@ zy of recent years may be <@@ unk@@ > 
 this is a reaction to <@@ unk@@ > l@@ bo <@@ unk@@ > rather than to any funda@@ mentals said jo@@ hn young chairman of he@@ w@@ lett@@ -@@ pack@@ ard co@@ . whose shares dropped $ N to $ N 
 if we get rid of a lot of that nonsense it will be a big plus 
 a few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the business council a group that meets to discuss national issues were only too happy to <@@ unk@@ > their criticism 
 people wish the government would do something about le@@ ver@@ aged bu@@ y-@@ outs do something about take@@ overs do something about donald tru@@ mp said r@@ and <@@ unk@@ > chairman of it@@ t cor@@ p. whose stock dropped $ N 
 where 's the leadership 
 where 's the guy who can say enough is enough 
 the executives were <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > by the plun@@ ge even though it <@@ unk@@ > billions of dollars off the value of their companies and millions off their personal fortunes 
 i 'm not going to worry about one day 's decline said ken@@ ne@@ th <@@ unk@@ > digital equipment cor@@ p. president who was <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the <@@ unk@@ > here after his company 's shares plun@@ ged $ N to close at $ N 
 i did n't bother calling anybody i did n't even turn on tv 
 there has n't been any fundamental change in the economy added jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > whose proc@@ ter & gamble co@@ . took an $ N slide to close at $ N 
 the fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem 
 of course established corporate <@@ unk@@ > often tend to <@@ unk@@ > the setbacks of stock specul@@ ators and take@@ over artists 
 indeed one chief executive who was down@@ right <@@ unk@@ > by friday 's events was ro@@ bert cr@@ and@@ all chairman of am@@ r cor@@ p. the parent of american airlines and the target of a take@@ over offer by m@@ r@@ . tru@@ mp 
 asked whether friday 's action could help him avoid being <@@ unk@@ > by the new y@@ ork real estate <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . cr@@ and@@ all <@@ unk@@ > broad@@ ly and said no comment 
 on friday morning before the market 's sel@@ l-@@ off the business leaders issued a report predic@@ ting the economy would grow at roughly an infla@@ tion-@@ adjusted N N annual rate through next year then accelerate <@@ unk@@ > in N 
 of the N econom@@ ists who worked on the business council forecast only two projected periods of decline in the nation 's output over the next two years and in both <@@ unk@@ > the decl@@ ines are too modest to war@@ r@@ ant the phrase recession said le@@ w@@ is <@@ unk@@ > chairman of j@@ .@@ p. mor@@ gan & co@@ . and vice chairman of the business council 
 the real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of new y@@ ork office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market 
 in man@@ hattan <@@ unk@@ > store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill 
 retail real estate bro@@ kers say ten@@ ants are reluctant to sign leas@@ es because of uncertainty about the local economy tur@@ mo@@ il in their own industries and a belief that <@@ unk@@ > have not yet hit bottom 
 there is an <@@ unk@@ > amount of space available says faith <@@ unk@@ > senior vice president at <@@ unk@@ > associates store leas@@ ing in@@ c 
 there are about N stores for rent up from a more typical range of N to N 
 this further <@@ unk@@ > retailers she says 
 they wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down 
 is this the wrong time to open a store 
 who is going to be in the space next door 
 in addition m@@ s. <@@ unk@@ > says ten@@ ants usually can negotiate to pay <@@ unk@@ > that are about <@@ unk@@ > lower than <@@ unk@@ > ' initial asking price 
 a handful of hot retail locations such as the <@@ unk@@ > street and ma@@ di@@ son and fifth avenue areas have been able to sustain what many see as <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 and in some neighbor@@ hoods <@@ unk@@ > have merely hit a <@@ unk@@ > 
 but on average man@@ hattan retail <@@ unk@@ > have dropped N N to N N in the past six months alone experts say 
 that follows a more <@@ unk@@ > decline in the prior six months after man@@ hattan <@@ unk@@ > had run up rapidly since N 
 the same factors limiting demand for office space have affected reta@@ iling 
 as businesses contract or <@@ unk@@ > the number of employees who might use retail services <@@ unk@@ > says ed@@ ward a@@ . <@@ unk@@ > senior vice president of hel@@ m@@ sley <@@ unk@@ > in@@ c 
 he says financial problems <@@ unk@@ > electronics fur and furniture companies key categories in the local retail economy have further <@@ unk@@ > the market 
 hardest hit are what he calls secondary sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents 
 in these locations m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and <@@ unk@@ > have remained steady or in some cases have declined 
 weakness in the restaurant industry which is leaving retail space vacant <@@ unk@@ > the problem for <@@ unk@@ > 
 it is also no comfort to <@@ unk@@ > and small new y@@ ork retailers when the future of larger department stores which <@@ unk@@ > retail neighbor@@ hoods are in doubt

 the trend toward lower <@@ unk@@ > may seem surprising given that some communities in new y@@ ork are <@@ unk@@ > the loss of favorite local businesses to high <@@ unk@@ > 
 but despite the recent sof@@ tening for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s when their leas@@ es were signed 
 certainly the recent drop in prices does n't mean man@@ hattan comes cheap

 when justice wi@@ lli@@ am <@@ unk@@ > marks the start of his <@@ unk@@ > year on the supreme court today the occasion will differ sharply from previous <@@ unk@@ > of his ten@@ ure 
 for the first time the <@@ unk@@ > justice finds his influence almost exclusively in diss@@ ent rather than as a force in the high court 's majority 
 this role re@@ versal holds true as well for his three liberal and moderate al@@ lies jus@@ tices <@@ unk@@ > mar@@ shall har@@ ry <@@ unk@@ > and jo@@ hn st@@ ev@@ ens 
 but are these four players three of them in their <@@ unk@@ > ready to assume a different role after N years <@@ unk@@ > of service on the high court 
 every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role and the <@@ unk@@ > that go with it but in different ways 
 jus@@ tices <@@ unk@@ > and st@@ ev@@ ens appear <@@ unk@@ > about it jus@@ tices mar@@ shall and <@@ unk@@ > appear fighting mad 
 the four jus@@ tices are no newcomers to diss@@ ent often joining forces in the past decade to <@@ unk@@ > the court 's conservative <@@ unk@@ > 
 but always in years past they have <@@ unk@@ > the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to <@@ unk@@ > out a number of major vic@@ tories in civil rights and <@@ unk@@ > cases 
 now however as the court 's new <@@ unk@@ > conservative majority continues to <@@ unk@@ > vic@@ tories for the liber@@ als are rare 
 the change is most dramatic for justice <@@ unk@@ > the last <@@ unk@@ > of the <@@ unk@@ > liberal majority under chief justice <@@ unk@@ > war@@ ren 
 in the seven supreme court terms from the fall of N through the spring of N the <@@ unk@@ > of the war@@ ren court 's power justice <@@ unk@@ > cast only N <@@ unk@@ > votes in N cases decided by the court 
 last term alone he cast N <@@ unk@@ > votes in N decisions with the con@@ ten@@ tious <@@ unk@@ > ruling as his only big victory 
 but justice <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > his new role strongly defending the importance of <@@ unk@@ > in a N speech 
 each time the court <@@ unk@@ > an issue the jus@@ tices will be forced by a diss@@ ent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to <@@ unk@@ > the result he said 
 moreover in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s he knew that the tables might turn in the future 
 he has said that he now knows how justice jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > felt a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent <@@ unk@@ > from the war@@ ren court 's opinions 
 associates of <@@ unk@@ > justice mar@@ shall say he was depressed about the court 's direction last spring but is <@@ unk@@ > about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cut@@ backs in civil rights 
 we could sweep it under the <@@ unk@@ > and hide it but i 'm not going to do it he said in a speech last month 
 he like justice <@@ unk@@ > considers <@@ unk@@ > highly important for the future a point that has n't escaped legal scholars 
 harv@@ ard law school professor la@@ ur@@ ence tribe says there is a <@@ unk@@ > flavor to current <@@ unk@@ > 
 the <@@ unk@@ > in the war@@ ren court he says appeared to be writing for the short-term suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon 
 <@@ unk@@ > and mar@@ shall are speaking in their <@@ unk@@ > to a more distant future he says 
 justice <@@ unk@@ > who will turn N next month also seems <@@ unk@@ > about his new role 
 associates say he takes some <@@ unk@@ > more personally than his colleagues especially attempts to cur@@ tail the right to abortion first recognized in his N opinion roe vs. wa@@ de 
 friends and associates who saw justice <@@ unk@@ > during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years 
 and his outlook improved after successful <@@ unk@@ > surgery in au@@ gust 
 but his level of frustration showed in a recent <@@ unk@@ > speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in chic@@ ago 
 he concluded his remarks by <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and at some length according to those present the late mar@@ tin <@@ unk@@ > king 's famous i have a dream speech from the N march on wash@@ ington 
 justice st@@ ev@@ ens N is probably the most <@@ unk@@ > of the <@@ unk@@ > about his role in part because he may be the least liberal of the four but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others 
 if the role these four <@@ unk@@ > are assuming is a familiar one in modern supreme court history it also <@@ unk@@ > in an important way from recent history court watch@@ ers say 
 the <@@ unk@@ > of the war@@ ren court were often defending a legal <@@ unk@@ > that they inherited says prof@@ . <@@ unk@@ > dic@@ k how@@ ard of the university of vir@@ gin@@ ia law school but the <@@ unk@@ > today are defending a <@@ unk@@ > that they created 
 the government sold the deposi@@ ts of four sav@@ ing@@ s-and-@@ loan institutions in its first wave of sales of big sick thri@@ fts but low bi@@ ds prevented the sale of a fifth 
 the four s@@ &@@ ls were sold to large banks as was the case with most of the N previous transactions initiated by the resolution trust cor@@ p. since it was created in the s@@ &@@ l ba@@ il@@ out legislation two months ago 
 two of the four big thri@@ fts were sold to n@@ cn@@ b cor@@ p. char@@ lotte n.@@ c@@ . which has aggressively expanded its markets particularly in tex@@ as and fl@@ ori@@ da 
 a can@@ a@@ dian bank bought another thri@@ ft in the first r@@ t@@ c transaction with a foreign bank 
 under these deals the r@@ t@@ c sells just the deposi@@ ts and the healthy assets 
 these <@@ unk@@ > transactions leave the bulk of bad assets mostly real estate with the government to be sold later 
 in these four for instance the r@@ t@@ c is stuck with $ N billion in bad assets 
 <@@ unk@@ > paid premiums ranging from N N to N N for the deposi@@ ts and branch systems roughly in line with what analy@@ sts were expecting 
 the buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks as has been the case with previous deals 
 after that the buyers may <@@ unk@@ > the rates paid by the former thri@@ fts 
 but it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps 
 n@@ cn@@ b for example has been one of the highest rate <@@ unk@@ > in the tex@@ as market and in fl@@ ori@@ da rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities 
 the r@@ t@@ c had previously targeted five thri@@ fts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain bud@@ ge@@ tary deadlines but the delays illustrate the tough <@@ unk@@ > facing the agency 
 these thri@@ fts are <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > said <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > an industry consultant based in <@@ unk@@ > va 
 for example the delay in selling people 's heritage savings <@@ unk@@ > kan@@ . with $ N billion in assets has forced the r@@ t@@ c to consider selling off the thri@@ ft <@@ unk@@ > instead of as a whole institution 
 n@@ cn@@ b continued its <@@ unk@@ > into the fl@@ ori@@ da and tex@@ as markets 
 n@@ cn@@ b will acquire university federal savings association hou@@ ston which had assets of $ N billion 
 n@@ cn@@ b tex@@ as national bank will pay the r@@ t@@ c a premium of $ N million for $ N billion in deposi@@ ts 
 as a measure of the <@@ unk@@ > to which the tex@@ as real estate market has <@@ unk@@ > the r@@ t@@ c will pay $ N billion to n@@ cn@@ b to take $ N million of bad assets 
 n@@ cn@@ b also acquired freedom savings & loan association ta@@ mp@@ a fla@@ . which had total assets of $ N million 
 n@@ cn@@ b will pay the r@@ t@@ c a premium of $ N million for $ N billion in deposi@@ ts 
 n@@ cn@@ b will also acquire $ N million of freedom 's assets from the r@@ t@@ c which will require $ N million in assistance 
 mer@@ i@@ dian ban@@ cor@@ p inc@@ . reading pa@@ . will acquire hill financial savings association red hill pa@@ . which had $ N billion in assets 
 mer@@ i@@ dian will pay a premium of $ N million to assume $ N billion in deposi@@ ts 
 it will also purchase $ N million of the thri@@ ft 's assets with $ N billion in r@@ t@@ c assistance 
 in the first r@@ t@@ c transaction with a foreign buyer royal <@@ unk@@ > l@@ t@@ d. tor@@ onto will acquire p@@ acific savings bank co@@ sta me@@ sa cali@@ f@@ . which had $ N million in assets

 time magazine in a move to reduce the costs of woo@@ ing new subscri@@ bers is lowering its circulation guarantee to adver@@ tis@@ ers for the second consecutive year increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise <@@ unk@@ > 
 in an announcement to its staff last week executives at time war@@ ner inc@@ . 's weekly magazine said time will dramatically <@@ unk@@ > its use of electronic <@@ unk@@ > such as telephones in television subscription drives cut the circulation it guaran@@ tees adver@@ tis@@ ers by N to four million and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ N to $ N 
 in a related development the <@@ unk@@ > for the fourth year in a row said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in N a full <@@ unk@@ > page in the magazine costs about $ N 
 however because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered ad rates will be effectively N N higher per subscri@@ ber according to rich@@ ard <@@ unk@@ > time associate publisher 
 time is following the course of some other <@@ unk@@ > magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing <@@ unk@@ > that maintaining arti@@ ficially high and expensive <@@ unk@@ > is the way to draw adver@@ tis@@ ers 
 in recent years reader 's digest new y@@ ork times co@@ . 's mc@@ call 's and most recently news cor@@ p. 's tv guide have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate mar@@ ginal circulation and hold down rates for adver@@ tis@@ ers 
 deep discounts in <@@ unk@@ > and offers of free <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscri@@ bers in the <@@ unk@@ > world of magazine <@@ unk@@ > 
 but time as part of the more <@@ unk@@ > time war@@ ner wants to <@@ unk@@ > itself away from expensive <@@ unk@@ > 
 besides time executives think selling a news magazine with a <@@ unk@@ > radio is <@@ unk@@ > 
 <@@ unk@@ > just give people the wrong image said m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 
 that perception takes the focus off the magazine 
 time magazine executives predic@@ t@@ ably <@@ unk@@ > the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to adver@@ tis@@ ers 
 what we are doing is <@@ unk@@ > out the readers who are only <@@ unk@@ > related to the magazine and do n't really read it said m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 
 we are trying to create quality and involvement 
 however time executives used the same explanation when in oc@@ to@@ ber N the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from N million to N million 
 and time 's paid circulation according to audit burea@@ u of <@@ unk@@ > dropped N N to N in the six months ended j@@ une N N 
 still time 's move is being received well once again 
 it 's <@@ unk@@ > for adver@@ tis@@ ers to know the reader will be paying more said mic@@ ha@@ el <@@ unk@@ > national media director at bo@@ ze@@ ll inc@@ . ad agency 
 a few drops in circulation are of no consequence 
 it 's not a show of weakness they are improving the quality of circulation while <@@ unk@@ > their profits 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry a magazine 's net revenue per subscri@@ ber or the actual revenue from subscri@@ bers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stri@@ pped away 
 the question is how much are we getting from each reader said m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 
 time 's rivals <@@ unk@@ > wash@@ ington post co@@ . 's news@@ week and u@@ .s@@ . news & world report are less <@@ unk@@ > on electronic <@@ unk@@ > and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases 
 both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for N within a month 
 when the news broke of an attempted c@@ oup in pan@@ ama two weeks ago sen@@ . chri@@ stop@@ her do@@ dd called the state department for a briefing 
 they said follow <@@ unk@@ > he told reporters 
 that shows how far ted tur@@ ner 's cable news network has come since its birth nine years ago when it was considered the <@@ unk@@ > of television news 
 it is bigger faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks 
 its nic@@ he as the network of record during major crises draws elite audiences around the world 
 but for all its success <@@ unk@@ > has hit a <@@ unk@@ > 
 although <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > when big news breaks it <@@ unk@@ > during periods of calm 
 <@@ unk@@ > executives worry that the network 's <@@ unk@@ > but <@@ unk@@ > news format may be getting <@@ unk@@ > and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives <@@ unk@@ > for news and information on cab@@ le-@@ tv 
 just the fact we 're on N hours is no longer <@@ unk@@ > says ed tur@@ ner <@@ unk@@ > 's executive vice president news gathering and no <@@ unk@@ > to ted tur@@ ner 
 you ca n't live on that 
 so <@@ unk@@ > a unit of at@@ lan@@ ta@@ -based tur@@ ner broadcasting system inc@@ . is trying to <@@ unk@@ > itself as a primary channel or what people in the television industry call a top of mind network 
 tonight to kick off the effort <@@ unk@@ > will premiere its first pri@@ me@@ -time <@@ unk@@ > in years an <@@ unk@@ > show at N p.m eastern time to air <@@ unk@@ > against the network <@@ unk@@ > 
 the show will be <@@ unk@@ > by ber@@ n@@ ard sha@@ w and <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > former tex@@ as judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism 
 the new show is perhaps the <@@ unk@@ > in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more <@@ unk@@ > signature programming with <@@ unk@@ > stars 
 to <@@ unk@@ > itself <@@ unk@@ > is also expanding international coverage and adding a second <@@ unk@@ > program 
 it is paying higher salaries after years of <@@ unk@@ > to lure and keep experienced staff@@ ers 
 and it is <@@ unk@@ > on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large <@@ unk@@ > team 
 the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables says j@@ on <@@ unk@@ > executive vice president of headline news <@@ unk@@ > 's sister network 
 but that wo n't be easy 
 networks like other consumer products develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change 
 it also takes money that <@@ unk@@ > has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see 
 and the cab@@ le-@@ tv operators <@@ unk@@ > 's distribu@@ tors and part owners like things just the way they are 
 the <@@ unk@@ > bid is aimed at <@@ unk@@ > 's <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and what may happen to it as the cab@@ le-@@ tv news market grows more competitive 
 already <@@ unk@@ > is facing stronger competition from financial news network inc@@ . and general electric co@@ . 's consumer news and business channel both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future 
 in addition many cab@@ le-@@ tv systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations 
 <@@ unk@@ > wants to change its viewers ' habits 
 its watch@@ ers are on the whole a <@@ unk@@ > group of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and news <@@ unk@@ > who spend an average of just N minutes a day watching <@@ unk@@ > according to audience research 
 that 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks 
 the brief attention viewers give <@@ unk@@ > could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data and advertising become more important to cab@@ le-@@ tv channels 
 <@@ unk@@ > 's <@@ unk@@ > habits have been <@@ unk@@ > by its format 
 its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service 
 it focused on building up its news burea@@ us around the world so as events took place it could go live <@@ unk@@ > and longer than other networks 
 it filled its daily schedule with <@@ unk@@ > called <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > but the shows <@@ unk@@ > little in content <@@ unk@@ > or look 
 now the push is on for <@@ unk@@ > shows 
 our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity says pa@@ ul <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > executive vice president for programming 
 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > is adding a <@@ unk@@ > show in the morning because surveys show its <@@ unk@@ > hour in the afternoon is among its most <@@ unk@@ > programs in viewers ' minds says m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 
 and it is exploring other original programs similar to its lar@@ ry king live and <@@ unk@@ > talk shows which executives hope will keep people <@@ unk@@ > in 
 then there 's the world today the pri@@ me@@ -time <@@ unk@@ > featuring m@@ r@@ . sha@@ w and m@@ s. <@@ unk@@ > 
 until now <@@ unk@@ > has featured its ho@@ lly@@ wood <@@ unk@@ > show during the key evening period 
 but N N of the <@@ unk@@ > households that watch news do so between N p.m. and N p.m. the network discovered so <@@ unk@@ > wants in 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says the <@@ unk@@ > team will probably do two live interviews a day with most of the program at least for now appearing similar to <@@ unk@@ > 's other <@@ unk@@ > 
 some in the industry are skeptical 
 i find it hard to <@@ unk@@ > of people switching over to <@@ unk@@ > for what at least in the public 's mind is the same news says <@@ unk@@ > frank the former <@@ unk@@ > president of nb@@ c news and <@@ unk@@ > of the <@@ unk@@ > report 
 the evening news is also s@@ lated as <@@ unk@@ > 's stage for its big push into <@@ unk@@ > journalism 
 in au@@ gust the network hired <@@ unk@@ > producer <@@ unk@@ > hill the former head of news <@@ unk@@ > at ab@@ c 
 she 's <@@ unk@@ > a staff of about N <@@ unk@@ > reporters who will produce weekly <@@ unk@@ > segments with an eye toward breaking big stories 
 <@@ unk@@ > executives hope the <@@ unk@@ > created by such <@@ unk@@ > will generate excitement for its <@@ unk@@ > programs in the way N minutes did so well for c@@ bs 
 that 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical <@@ unk@@ > will follow through with its <@@ unk@@ > commitment especially after it sees the cost of producing <@@ unk@@ > pieces 
 they 've never shown any <@@ unk@@ > to spend money on production says mic@@ ha@@ el <@@ unk@@ > a senior producer with <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > who notes that <@@ unk@@ > is <@@ unk@@ > to his job 
 the network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards resulting in a <@@ unk@@ > work force 
 <@@ unk@@ > recently gave most employees raises of as much as N N but they 're still drastically <@@ unk@@ > compared with the networks 
 says m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > is my wire service they 're on top of everything 
 but to improve they 've really got to make the investment in people 
 in any case <@@ unk@@ > operators have reason to fear any <@@ unk@@ > with <@@ unk@@ > 's format 
 they market cab@@ le-@@ tv on the very <@@ unk@@ > opportunities <@@ unk@@ > seeks to discourage 
 we would obviously be upset if those kinds of services <@@ unk@@ > into more <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > programming says ro@@ bert <@@ unk@@ > senior vice president programming of contin@@ ental <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . which holds a N N stake in tur@@ ner broadcasting 
 the second u@@ .s@@ . circuit court of appeals opinion in the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > case did not <@@ unk@@ > the position pen@@ n@@ z@@ oil co@@ . took in its dispute with tex@@ ac@@ o contrary to your sep@@ t. N article court backs tex@@ ac@@ o 's view in pen@@ n@@ z@@ oil case too late 
 the fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound 
 in the <@@ unk@@ > li@@ ti@@ gation the courts found pen@@ n@@ z@@ oil and <@@ unk@@ > oil intended to be bound in <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > they found there was no intention to be bound 
 <@@ unk@@ > the principle in the cases is the same

 valley federal savings & loan association said imperial cor@@ p. of america withdrew from regul@@ ators its application to buy five valley federal branches leaving the transaction in li@@ mbo 
 the broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at imperial cor@@ p. whose spo@@ kes@@ man said the company withdrew its application from the federal office of thri@@ ft supervision because of an informal notice that imperial 's thri@@ ft unit failed to meet community re@@ investment act requirements 
 the community re@@ investment act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposi@@ ts are received 
 the transaction announced in au@@ gust included about $ N million in deposi@@ ts at the five outlets in cali@@ for@@ nia 's san <@@ unk@@ > valley 
 terms were n't disclosed but valley federal had said it expected to post a modest pre@@ tax gain and to save about $ N million in operating costs annually 
 valley federal said friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with imperial cor@@ p. which said it is attempting to meet community re@@ investment act requirements 
 valley federal with assets of $ N billion is based in van <@@ unk@@ > 
 imperial cor@@ p. based in san di@@ ego is the parent of imperial savings & loan 
 in the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $ N million

 september 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still <@@ unk@@ > and the <@@ unk@@ > over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plun@@ ge friday 
 after falling for three consecutive months the producer price index for finished goods shot up N N last month the labor department reported friday as energy prices jumped after tu@@ mbling through the summer 
 although the report which was released before the stock market opened did n't trigger the 19@@ 0.@@ 5@@ 8-@@ point drop in the d@@ ow j@@ ones industrial average analy@@ sts said it did play a role in the market 's decline 
 analy@@ sts immediately viewed the price data the <@@ unk@@ > inflation news in months as evidence that the federal reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped 
 further fu@@ eling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the fed from easing credit the commerce department reported friday that retail sales grew N N in september to $ N billion 
 that rise came on top of a N N gain in au@@ gust and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy 
 i think the friday report combined with the actions of the fed weakened the belief that there was going to be an im@@ minent easing of monetary policy said ro@@ bert <@@ unk@@ > chief economist at northern trust co@@ . in chic@@ ago 
 but econom@@ ists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat sign@@ aled by the new numbers 
 the overall N N increase is serious in itself but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy the producer price index still increased by N N said gor@@ don <@@ unk@@ > an economist at the national association of manufacturers 
 but sung won <@@ unk@@ > chief economist at <@@ unk@@ > cor@@ p. in min@@ ne@@ ap@@ olis blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the september jump 
 i would say this is not bad news this is a <@@ unk@@ > he said 
 the core rate is not really out of line 
 all year energy prices have <@@ unk@@ > the producer price index which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods 
 inflation <@@ unk@@ > has fallen back from its <@@ unk@@ > pace last winter when a steep <@@ unk@@ > in world oil prices sent the index sur@@ ging at double-@@ digit annual rates 
 energy prices then plu@@ mme@@ ted through the summer causing the index to decline for three consecutive months 
 overall the index has climbed at a N N compound annual rate since the start of the year the labor department said 
 while far more <@@ unk@@ > than the pace at the beginning of the year that is still a <@@ unk@@ > rise than the N N increase for all of N 
 moreover this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month when energy prices <@@ unk@@ > up N N after plun@@ ging N N in au@@ gust 
 some analy@@ sts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain 
 analy@@ sts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index but the N N climb was higher than most anticipated 
 i think the <@@ unk@@ > in inflation is going to continue for a few months said jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > chief economist at bell <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > a wash@@ ington economic fore@@ casting firm 
 he predicted that inflation will moderate next year saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide 
 but <@@ unk@@ > van <@@ unk@@ > president of the national association of <@@ unk@@ > said that last month 's rise is n't as bad an <@@ unk@@ > as the N N figure suggests 
 if you examine the data carefully the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices rather than being a broad@@ -based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods he explained 
 passenger car prices jumped N N in september after climbing N N in au@@ gust and declining in the late spring and summer 
 many analy@@ sts said the september increase was a one-@@ time event coming as dealers introduced their N models 
 although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctu@@ ations car prices rose beyond the <@@ unk@@ > autumn increase 
 prices for capital equipment rose a he@@ fty N N in september while prices for home electronic equipment fell N N 
 food prices declined N N after climbing N N in au@@ gust 
 meanwhile the retail sales report showed that car sales rose N N in september to $ N billion 
 but at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices analy@@ sts said 
 sales at general merchandise stores rose N N after declining N N in au@@ gust while sales of building materials fell N N after rising N N 
 producer prices for intermediate goods grew N N in september after dropping for three consecutive months 
 prices for crude goods an arr@@ ay of raw materials jumped N N after declining N N in au@@ gust and <@@ unk@@ > up N N in july 
 here are the labor department 's producer price inde@@ xes N <@@ unk@@ > N for september before seasonal adjustment and the percentage changes from september N 
 <@@ unk@@ > financial cor@@ p. said it expects to report a loss of at least $ N million to $ N million for the third quarter 
 in the year-@@ earlier period <@@ unk@@ > had net income of $ N but no per@@ -@@ share earnings 
 <@@ unk@@ > 's president and chief executive officer jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > said the loss stems from several factors 
 he said non@@ performing assets rose to slightly more than $ N million from $ N million between j@@ une and september 
 approximately N N of the total <@@ unk@@ > of non@@ performing commercial real estate assets 
 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > estimated that it will provide between $ N million and $ N million for credit losses in the third quarter 
 <@@ unk@@ > added that significant additional lo@@ an-@@ loss pro@@ visions may be required by federal regul@@ ators as part of the current annual examination of city federal savings bank <@@ unk@@ > 's primary subsidiary based in <@@ unk@@ > n.@@ j 
 city federal operates N banking offices in new jer@@ sey and fl@@ ori@@ da 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said <@@ unk@@ > will also mark its portfolio of high-@@ yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions <@@ unk@@ > themselves of such bonds 
 that action <@@ unk@@ > said will result in a charge against third-@@ quarter results of approximately $ N million 
 <@@ unk@@ > also said it expects to shed its remaining mort@@ gage loan <@@ unk@@ > operations outside its principal markets in new jer@@ sey and fl@@ ori@@ da and as a result is taking a charge for dis@@ continued operations 
 all these actions m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said will result in a loss of $ N million to $ N million for the third quarter 
 he added however depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mort@@ g@@ ages <@@ unk@@ > and the outcome of the annual examination of city federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range 
 cent@@ r@@ ust savings bank said federal thri@@ ft regul@@ ators ordered it to su@@ spend divi@@ d@@ end payments on its two classes of preferred stock indicating that regul@@ ators ' concerns about the troubled institution have he@@ igh@@ tened 
 in a statement mi@@ ami-@@ based cent@@ r@@ ust said the regul@@ ators cited the thri@@ ft 's operating losses and apparent losses in its jun@@ k-@@ bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the divi@@ d@@ ends 
 regul@@ ators also ordered cent@@ r@@ ust to stop buying back the preferred stock 
 da@@ vid l@@ . pa@@ ul chairman and chief executive officer criticized the federal office of thri@@ ft supervision which issued the <@@ unk@@ > saying it was inappropriate and based on insufficient reasons 
 he said the thri@@ ft will try to get regul@@ ators to reverse the decision 
 the suspension of a preferred stock divi@@ d@@ end is a serious step that signals that regul@@ ators have deep concerns about an institution 's health 
 in march regul@@ ators labeled cent@@ r@@ ust a troubled institution largely because of its big jun@@ k-@@ bond hol@@ dings and its operating losses 
 in the same month the office of thri@@ ft supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock divi@@ d@@ ends until its operations were on track 
 for the nine months ended j@@ une N cent@@ r@@ ust had a net loss of $ N million compared with year-@@ earlier net income of $ N million 
 cent@@ r@@ ust which is fl@@ ori@@ da 's largest thri@@ ft holds one of the largest jun@@ k-@@ bond port@@ foli@@ os of any thri@@ ft in the nation 
 since april it has <@@ unk@@ > its high-@@ yield bond hol@@ dings to about $ N million from $ N billion 
 m@@ r@@ . pa@@ ul said only about $ N million of the current hol@@ dings are <@@ unk@@ > securi@@ ties registered with the securi@@ ties and exchange commission 
 the remainder he said are commercial loan <@@ unk@@ > or private <@@ unk@@ > that are n't filed with the sec and do n't have a ready market 
 cent@@ r@@ ust and regul@@ ators have been in a dispute over market <@@ unk@@ > for the junk bonds 
 the office of thri@@ ft supervision has been <@@ unk@@ > cent@@ r@@ ust to provide current market values for its hol@@ dings but cent@@ r@@ ust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative <@@ unk@@ > of the bonds and lack of a ready market 
 regul@@ ators have become increasingly <@@ unk@@ > about cent@@ r@@ ust 's and other thri@@ fts ' jun@@ k-@@ bond hol@@ dings in light of the recent federal thri@@ ft ba@@ il@@ out legislation and the recent deep decline in the jun@@ k-@@ bond market 
 the legislation requires thri@@ fts to <@@ unk@@ > themselves of junk bonds in the new <@@ unk@@ > regul@@ atory climate 
 in american stock exchange compo@@ site trading friday cent@@ r@@ ust common shares closed at $ N down N cents 
 in a statement friday m@@ r@@ . pa@@ ul challenged the regul@@ ators ' decision saying the thri@@ ft 's operating losses and apparent jun@@ k-@@ bond losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank 
 he also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds 
 in the third quarter for instance cent@@ r@@ ust added $ N million to its general reserves 
 m@@ r@@ . pa@@ ul said the regul@@ ators should instead move ahead with <@@ unk@@ > cent@@ r@@ ust 's request to sell N of its N branches to great western bank a unit of great western financial cor@@ p. based in bever@@ ly hills cali@@ f 
 the branch sale is the cent@@ er@@ piece of cent@@ r@@ ust 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional s@@ &@@ l from a <@@ unk@@ > institution that relied heavily on securi@@ ties trading for profits according to m@@ r@@ . pa@@ ul 
 most analy@@ sts and thri@@ ft executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction which was announced in july long before now 
 many interpret the delay as an indication that regul@@ ators are skeptical about the proposal 
 branches and deposi@@ ts can be sold at a premium in the event federal regul@@ ators take over an institution 
 cent@@ r@@ ust however <@@ unk@@ > the branch sale saying it would bring in $ N million and reduce the thri@@ ft 's assets to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 it said the sale would give it positive tang@@ ible capital of $ N million or about N N of assets from a negative $ N million as of sep@@ t. N thus bringing cent@@ r@@ ust close to regul@@ atory standards 
 cent@@ r@@ ust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ N million 
 critics however say the branch sale will make cent@@ r@@ ust more dependent than ever on <@@ unk@@ > deposi@@ ts and junk bonds 
 m@@ r@@ . pa@@ ul <@@ unk@@ > that he intends to further <@@ unk@@ > the size of cent@@ r@@ ust by not renew@@ ing more than $ N billion of <@@ unk@@ > certificates of deposit when they come due 
 the thri@@ ft is also working to un@@ load its jun@@ k-@@ bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affili@@ ate as required under the new thri@@ ft law

 the woman won the bet 
 but perhaps even more remarkable the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > make a bet regularly wins the top <@@ unk@@ > in the country 's tv ratings sometimes drawing as many as N N of west german households 
 as the N economic integration approaches eur@@ ope 's cultural <@@ unk@@ > have taken to the <@@ unk@@ > against american cultural <@@ unk@@ > threatening to impose quo@@ tas against such pop <@@ unk@@ > as dal@@ las mi@@ ami vice and l.@@ a@@ . law 
 but much of what the eur@@ op@@ eans want to protect seems every bit as <@@ unk@@ > as what they are trying to keep out 
 the most <@@ unk@@ > opposition to american tv imports has come from french television and movie producers who have demanded quo@@ tas ensuring that a full N N of eur@@ ope 's tv shows be produced in eur@@ ope 
 so far the french have failed to win enough broad@@ -based support to prev@@ ail 
 a <@@ unk@@ > through the television list@@ ings and a few <@@ unk@@ > of the eur@@ op@@ ean television dial suggest one reason why 
 while there are some popular action and drama series few <@@ unk@@ > the high culture and <@@ unk@@ > production values one might expect 
 more eur@@ op@@ ean air time is filled with <@@ unk@@ > game shows variety hours movies and talk shows many of which are authorized <@@ unk@@ > of their american counterparts 
 one of fr@@ ance 's most popular saturday night programs features <@@ unk@@ > seeking out their <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > for <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 a <@@ unk@@ > game show has as its host a bel@@ gian <@@ unk@@ > to be italian 
 one of it@@ aly 's favorite shows <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > variety show is so popular that viewers <@@ unk@@ > to buy a <@@ unk@@ > product <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > whose <@@ unk@@ > were sung each week by <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > even though the product did n't exist

 a celebrity guest u@@ .s@@ . ambassador to west ger@@ many rich@@ ard bur@@ t also won a bet that someone could pile up $ N worth of quarters on a <@@ unk@@ > coin 
 m@@ r@@ . bur@@ t nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost agre@@ eing to spend a day with west german foreign minister <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and selling their combined weight in potato <@@ unk@@ > 
 if this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the <@@ unk@@ > barriers it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get 
 eur@@ op@@ ean programs usually target only their own local audience and often only a small portion of that 
 <@@ unk@@ > in ger@@ many or it@@ aly rarely make it even to fr@@ ance or great bri@@ tain and almost never show up on u@@ .s@@ . screens 
 attempts to produce <@@ unk@@ > programs have generally resulted in disappointment 
 one annual <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > song contest featuring <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > from each of N eur@@ op@@ ean countries has been described as the world 's most boring tv show 
 another <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > where <@@ unk@@ > from <@@ unk@@ > eur@@ op@@ ean countries make <@@ unk@@ > of themselves performing <@@ unk@@ > tasks is a hit in fr@@ ance 
 a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > under the title almost anything goes <@@ unk@@ > fast 
 for the most part what 's made here stays here and for good reason 
 the <@@ unk@@ > of the british crop the literary <@@ unk@@ > that are shown on u@@ .s@@ . public television as <@@ unk@@ > theater make up a relatively small part of british air time 
 most british programming is more of an acquired taste 
 there is for instance one man and his dog a <@@ unk@@ > contest among sheep dogs 
 also <@@ unk@@ > to the british are hours of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > even more hours of lawn bowling <@@ unk@@ > and still more hours of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 eur@@ op@@ ean drama has had better though still mixed fortunes 
 the most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns 
 a french <@@ unk@@ > of dal@@ las called <@@ unk@@ > and set in a french <@@ unk@@ > had a good run in fr@@ ance which ended after the female lead was injured in a <@@ unk@@ > auto accident 
 <@@ unk@@ > black forest clinic a kind of german <@@ unk@@ > elsewhere set in a health <@@ unk@@ > is popular in ger@@ many and has spread into fr@@ ance 
 it@@ aly 's most popular series is a drama called la <@@ unk@@ > or the <@@ unk@@ > which <@@ unk@@ > the fight of an <@@ unk@@ > young investig@@ ator in <@@ unk@@ > against the mafia 
 it was <@@ unk@@ > news in it@@ aly earlier this year when the <@@ unk@@ > inspec@@ tor was <@@ unk@@ > down in the series 
 spa@@ in 's most popular <@@ unk@@ > this year was <@@ unk@@ > the story of an aging <@@ unk@@ > 
 the trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular with american programs second says bri@@ an <@@ unk@@ > a former director of programs for the british broadcasting cor@@ p 
 given a choice everybody will watch a <@@ unk@@ > show 
 but frequently there is n't much choice 
 thus eur@@ ope has begun the recent cru@@ sa@@ de to produce more worthy shows of its own programs with broader appeal 
 we 've basically got to start from <@@ unk@@ > to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see conce@@ des <@@ unk@@ > young head of bri@@ tain 's national film theatre school 
 while some in the u@@ .s@@ . cont@@ end that advertising is the <@@ unk@@ > of television here many believe that its absence is to blame for the eur@@ op@@ ean tv industry 's sluggish development 
 until recently national governments in eur@@ ope controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising 
 since production costs were guaranteed it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into <@@ unk@@ > as most american programs are 
 but not much money was spent on the shows either a situation that encouraged <@@ unk@@ > talk and game shows while discoura@@ ging <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 now however commercial channels are coming to most eur@@ op@@ ean countries and at the same time satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly 
 just last week gre@@ ece authorized two commercial channels for the first time spa@@ in earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels 
 the result is a new and huge appetite for programming 
 but perhaps to the <@@ unk@@ > of those calling for quo@@ tas most of this <@@ unk@@ > is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most <@@ unk@@ > programming now available rer@@ un@@ s usually of shows made in the u@@ .s@@ .

 after two years of talks plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek french and british government clearance 
 the companies hope for a final agreement by year-end 
 the venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies and help make them a leading force in eur@@ op@@ ean defense contracting

 yesterday a source close to <@@ unk@@ > confirmed that his company may join the fer@@ r@@ anti fight as part of a possible con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um that would bid against british a@@ ero@@ space and <@@ unk@@ >

 at least one potential <@@ unk@@ > partner <@@ unk@@ > insists it is n't interested in fer@@ r@@ anti 
 we have nothing to say about this affair which does n't concern us a <@@ unk@@ > official said sunday 
 the missile venture the british a@@ ero@@ space spo@@ kes@@ woman said is a needed response to the new environment in defense contracting 
 for both th@@ om@@ son and british a@@ ero@@ space earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly <@@ unk@@ > defense mini@@ stries and middle east sales a traditional main@@ stay for both companies ' exports have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices 
 the venture 's importance for th@@ om@@ son is great

 <@@ unk@@ > pipe line co@@ . said it will delay a proposed <@@ unk@@ > N million <@@ unk@@ > us@@ $ N million expansion of its system because canada 's output of crude oil is shrinking 
 <@@ unk@@ > canada 's biggest oil pi@@ pe@@ line operator and a major <@@ unk@@ > of crude to the u@@ .s@@ . said revised industry forecasts indicate that can@@ a@@ dian oil output will total about N million bar@@ re@@ ls a day by N N N lower than a previous estimate 
 can@@ a@@ dian crude production aver@@ aged about N million bar@@ re@@ ls a day during N 's first half about N N below the N level 
 the capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas said r@@ on@@ ald <@@ unk@@ > vice president for government and industry relations with <@@ unk@@ > 's parent <@@ unk@@ > energy in@@ c 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said volume on <@@ unk@@ > 's system is down about N N since jan@@ uary and is expected to fall further making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-@@ 1990s 
 there has been a swing of the <@@ unk@@ > back to the gas side he said 
 many of canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil and have shifted their exploration and development budgets <@@ unk@@ > 
 the number of active drilling <@@ unk@@ > in canada is down N N from a year ago and the number of completed oil wel@@ ls is down more than that due to the increasing focus on gas exploration said ro@@ bert <@@ unk@@ > manager of crude oil with cal@@ gary 's independent petroleum association of canada an industry group 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature conventional fields in western canada 
 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > about N N of all crude produced in western canada and almost N N of <@@ unk@@ > 's total volume consists of light crude 
 nearly all of the crude oil that canada exports to the u@@ .s@@ . is <@@ unk@@ > on <@@ unk@@ > 's system whose main line runs from <@@ unk@@ > to major u@@ .s@@ . and can@@ a@@ dian cities in the great <@@ unk@@ > region including chic@@ ago <@@ unk@@ > tor@@ onto and mon@@ tre@@ al 
 canada 's current oil exports to the u@@ .s@@ . total about N bar@@ re@@ ls a day or about N N of net u@@ .s@@ . crude imports said jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > president of the new y@@ or@@ k-@@ based petroleum industry research foundation 
 that ranks canada as the <@@ unk@@ > source of imported crude behind sau@@ di ar@@ abi@@ a <@@ unk@@ > and me@@ x@@ ico 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said canada 's declining crude output combined with the <@@ unk@@ > output of u@@ .s@@ . crude will help intensi@@ fy u@@ .s@@ . reliance on oil from overseas particularly the middle east 
 it 's very much a growing concern 
 but when something is inevitable you learn to live with it he said 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > stressed that the delay of <@@ unk@@ > 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase u@@ .s@@ . <@@ unk@@ > on off@@ shore crude however since can@@ a@@ dian imports are limited in any case by canada 's falling output 
 under terms of its proposed <@@ unk@@ > expansion which would have required regul@@ atory approval <@@ unk@@ > intended to add N bar@@ re@@ ls a day of additional capacity to its system beginning with a modest expansion by N

 inland steel industries inc@@ . expects to report that third-@@ quarter earnings dropped more than N N from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs 
 in the second quarter the ste@@ el@@ maker had net income of $ N million or $ N a share including a pre@@ tax charge of $ N million related to the sett@@ lement of a suit on sales of $ N billion 
 the company said normal seasonal sof@@ tness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced ship@@ ments by N tons in the latest quarter compared with the second quarter 
 at the same time the <@@ unk@@ > business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses as well as higher labor costs under its new contract 
 the <@@ unk@@ > business was hurt by reduced mar@@ gins and star@@ t-up costs associated with its jo@@ seph t. <@@ unk@@ > & son unit 
 the company said it is beginning to see some <@@ unk@@ > improvements in both the <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > segments which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter

 predic@@ ting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately

 investors taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the <@@ unk@@ > reacted by selling the company 's stock which lost $ N that day to close at $ N in national over-@@ the-@@ counter trading 
 but that was all of three months ago 
 last week micro@@ soft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended sep@@ t. N to increase N N 
 the announcement caused the company 's stock to surge $ N to close at $ N a share 
 micro@@ soft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for <@@ unk@@ > about the financial health of the computer firms 
 it 's hard to know what to expect at this point said pe@@ ter ro@@ gers an analy@@ st at ro@@ ber@@ t@@ son <@@ unk@@ > & co 
 the industry <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 to illustrate m@@ r@@ . ro@@ gers said that of the N <@@ unk@@ > firms he follows half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results and half above those results 
 among those companies expected to have a down quarter are he@@ w@@ lett@@ -@@ pack@@ ard co@@ . <@@ unk@@ > cor@@ p. and sun micro@@ systems inc@@ . generally solid performers in the past 
 international business machines cor@@ p. also is expected to report disappointing results 
 apple computer inc@@ . meanwhile is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended <@@ unk@@ > 
 another <@@ unk@@ > message comes from business@@ land inc@@ . a computer retailer 
 in july the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from apple and i@@ b@@ m had resulted in net income more than dou@@ bling for its fourth quarter ended j@@ une N to $ N million or N cents a share 
 this month however business@@ land warned investors that results for its first quarter ended sep@@ t. N had n't met expectations 
 the company said it expects earnings of N to N cents a share down from N cents a share in the year-@@ earlier period 
 while the earnings picture <@@ unk@@ > ob@@ servers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are <@@ unk@@ > 
 companies will continue to war over standards

 until recently ado@@ be had a lock on the market for image software but last month apple ado@@ be 's biggest customer and micro@@ soft <@@ unk@@ > 
 now the two firms are <@@ unk@@ > on an alternative to ado@@ be 's approach and analy@@ sts say they are likely to carry i@@ b@@ m the biggest seller of personal computers along with them 
 the short-term outlook for ado@@ be 's business however appears strong 
 the company is beginning to ship a new software program that 's being <@@ unk@@ > as a <@@ unk@@ > for owners of <@@ unk@@ > pr@@ inters sold by apple 
 the program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material 
 jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > ado@@ be 's chief executive officer said the mountain view cali@@ f@@ . company has been receiving N calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago 
 meanwhile competition between various operating systems which control the basic functions of a computer <@@ unk@@ > trouble for software firms generally 
 it creates uncertainty and usually <@@ unk@@ > down sales said <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > an analy@@ st at <@@ unk@@ > financial group 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of <@@ unk@@ > cor@@ p. maker of a widely used computer publishing program 
 he expects <@@ unk@@ > to report earnings of N cents a share on reven@@ ues of $ N million for its third quarter compared with earnings of N cents a share on revenue of N million in the year-@@ earlier period

 he said apple 's family of <@@ unk@@ > computers for instance uses four different buses and no one seems to mind 
 the gap between winners and <@@ unk@@ > will grow 
 in personal computers apple comp@@ a@@ q and i@@ b@@ m are expected to ti@@ ghten their hold on their business 
 at the same time <@@ unk@@ > firms will continue to lose ground 
 some lag@@ ging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether

 m@@ r@@ . brown estimates <@@ unk@@ > whose termin@@ als business is strong will report a loss of N cents a share for its quarter ended <@@ unk@@ > 
 person@@ al-@@ computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms 
 <@@ unk@@ > powerful <@@ unk@@ > computers designed with one or more microp@@ ro@@ cess@@ ors as their brains are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive min@@ ic@@ om@@ pu@@ ters and main@@ frames

 more elderly maintain their independence 
 thanks to modern medicine more couples are growing old together 
 and even after losing a spouse more of the elderly are staying independent 
 a new census burea@@ u study of the <@@ unk@@ > population shows that N N of people aged N to N were living with a spouse in N up from N N in N 
 this does n't mean they 're less likely to live alone however 
 that share has remained at about N N since N 
 what has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with sp@@ ou@@ ses rather than with other <@@ unk@@ > such as children 
 in N N N of those aged N to N lived with <@@ unk@@ > other than sp@@ ou@@ ses down from N N in N 
 as people get even older many become <@@ unk@@ > 
 but even among those aged N and older the share living with a spouse rose slightly to N N in N from N N in N 
 like their younger counterparts the older elderly are less likely to live with other <@@ unk@@ > 
 only N N of those aged N and older lived with <@@ unk@@ > other than sp@@ ou@@ ses in N down from N N in N 
 the likelihood of living alone beyond the age of N has increased to N N from N N 
 more people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off <@@ unk@@ > and financially

 many affluent people place personal success and money above family 
 at least that 's what a survey by ern@@ st & young and <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > indicates 
 two-@@ thirds of respon@@ dents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families 
 being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group 
 unlike most studies of the affluent market this survey excluded the <@@ unk@@ >

 the goal was to learn about one of today 's fast@@ est-@@ growing income groups the <@@ unk@@ > class

 across the board these consumers value quality buy what they like rather than just what they need and appreciate products that are distinctive 
 despite their considerable incomes and assets N N of the respon@@ dents in the study do n't feel financially secure and <@@ unk@@ > do n't feel that they have made it 
 <@@ unk@@ > percent do n't even feel they are financially well off 
 many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves either

 of all the ethnic <@@ unk@@ > in america which is the most troublesome right now

 not only is m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son the star of chicken soup he 's also the <@@ unk@@ > of a <@@ unk@@ > tradition dating back to duck soup and he 's currently a man in hot water 
 here in neutral language is the <@@ unk@@ > of m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son 's remarks quoted first in the village voice while he was a paid spo@@ kes@@ man for the rud@@ ol@@ ph gi@@ u@@ li@@ ani may@@ oral campaign and then in news@@ week after he and the campaign <@@ unk@@ > company 
 m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son said that many je@@ wish voters feel guilty toward bl@@ acks so they support black candidates <@@ unk@@ > 
 he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination so they too support black candidates <@@ unk@@ > 
 he said that <@@ unk@@ > have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice <@@ unk@@ > 
 of course m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son did not use neutral language

 he said <@@ unk@@ > were sick with <@@ unk@@ > and he called da@@ vid din@@ kins m@@ r@@ . gi@@ u@@ li@@ ani 's black opponent a fancy <@@ unk@@ > with a <@@ unk@@ > 
 if m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son had used less <@@ unk@@ > language to <@@ unk@@ > his <@@ unk@@ > analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow new <@@ unk@@ > would the water be quite so hot 
 it probably would because few or none of the people upset by m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son 's remarks have bothered to <@@ unk@@ > between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used <@@ unk@@ > language 
 in addition some of m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of <@@ unk@@ > 
 for example the new y@@ ork state coun@@ sel for the <@@ unk@@ > said that m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son is like a <@@ unk@@ > 
 people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck 
 these critics fail to <@@ unk@@ > between the type of ethnic humor that aims at <@@ unk@@ > another group such as polish jokes and the type that is <@@ unk@@ > aiming <@@ unk@@ > as well as <@@ unk@@ > 
 the latter typically is the humor of the <@@ unk@@ > and it was <@@ unk@@ > by both bl@@ acks and <@@ unk@@ > on the <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > stage as a means of <@@ unk@@ > their white and <@@ unk@@ > audiences along with themselves 
 in the hands of a <@@ unk@@ > like <@@ unk@@ > bru@@ ce this <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > could cut both the <@@ unk@@ > and the audience to <@@ unk@@ > 
 but <@@ unk@@ > by a pro like <@@ unk@@ > ma@@ son it is a <@@ unk@@ > form of <@@ unk@@ > 
 why <@@ unk@@ > 
 because despite all the media <@@ unk@@ > about comedy and politics not <@@ unk@@ > they are similar in one respect both can serve as <@@ unk@@ > for easing <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > of groups in conflict 
 that 's why it 's dangerous to have <@@ unk@@ > thought police on college <@@ unk@@ > and elsewhere <@@ unk@@ > all critical mention of group differences 
 as eli@@ za@@ beth <@@ unk@@ > wrote in the new y@@ ork times just before the ma@@ son <@@ unk@@ > perhaps <@@ unk@@ > would not <@@ unk@@ > over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to <@@ unk@@ > 
 the question is if group conflicts still exist as <@@ unk@@ > they do and if m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son 's type of ethnic humor is <@@ unk@@ > then what other means do we have for letting off steam 
 do n't say the tv <@@ unk@@ > because that happens to be a <@@ unk@@ > that in its desperate need to attract everybody and <@@ unk@@ > nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy 
 it is true that the best <@@ unk@@ > do allow group differences to <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > vs. blue-@@ collar <@@ unk@@ > in <@@ unk@@ > children vs. adults in the co@@ sby show 
 but these are not the differences that make <@@ unk@@ >

 it 's worth no@@ ting that both <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > are <@@ unk@@ > 
 at least they both speak with strong <@@ unk@@ > as do <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > 
 it could n't be more obvious that chicken soup is being made from an old <@@ unk@@ > 
 and a safe one imagine if the <@@ unk@@ > in question were between an orthodox <@@ unk@@ > and a member of the nation of <@@ unk@@ > 
 back in the 19@@ 20s the play and movie versions of <@@ unk@@ > 's i@@ rish rose made the theme of <@@ unk@@ > between the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > of je@@ wish and i@@ rish <@@ unk@@ > so popular that its author anne <@@ unk@@ > lost a <@@ unk@@ > suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public <@@ unk@@ >

 clearly the question with chicken soup is not whether the pot will <@@ unk@@ > over but whether it will <@@ unk@@ > at all

 for instance mic@@ ha@@ el <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > not because he 's a <@@ unk@@ > je@@ wish businessman but because he <@@ unk@@ > his <@@ unk@@ > job as a salesman in order to become a social worker 
 even more <@@ unk@@ > is the <@@ unk@@ > between <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son 's comic <@@ unk@@ > 
 the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son <@@ unk@@ > into his <@@ unk@@ > mode and starts <@@ unk@@ > out that old-fashioned je@@ wish <@@ unk@@ > to other people as well as to himself 
 but too often these <@@ unk@@ > lack s@@ park because this <@@ unk@@ > like all <@@ unk@@ > is <@@ unk@@ > about <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son 's stock in trade ethnic differences 
 i 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the <@@ unk@@ > dispute over the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > at <@@ unk@@ > 
 that issue like racial <@@ unk@@ > in new y@@ ork city will have to cool down not heat up before it can <@@ unk@@ > 
 but i am suggesting that they stop requiring m@@ r@@ . ma@@ son to <@@ unk@@ > his classic <@@ unk@@ > with some line about <@@ unk@@ > for other people that would sound <@@ unk@@ > on the <@@ unk@@ > of miss america

 the sen@@ ate 's decision to approve a <@@ unk@@ > defic@@ it-@@ reduction bill without a cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of <@@ unk@@ > a gains tax reduction this year 
 late friday night the sen@@ ate voted N to approve an estimated $ N billion measure that had been stri@@ pped of hundreds of pro@@ visions that would have wid@@ ened rather than narr@@ owed the federal budget deficit 
 law@@ makers drastically <@@ unk@@ > the bill to blunt criticism that it was blo@@ ated with speci@@ al-@@ interest tax breaks and spending increases 
 we 're putting a defic@@ it-@@ reduction bill back in the category of being a defic@@ it-@@ reduction bill said sen@@ ate budget committee chairman ja@@ mes <@@ unk@@ > d. <@@ unk@@ > 
 but sen@@ ate supporters of the <@@ unk@@ > legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside including a cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains tax cut 
 in addition the companion defic@@ it-@@ reduction bill already passed by the house includes a cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains provision 
 house-@@ sen@@ ate negotiations are likely to begin at <@@ unk@@ > and last for a while 
 no one can predict exactly what will happen on the house side said sen@@ ate minority leader ro@@ bert do@@ le r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 
 but he added i believe re@@ publi@@ cans and demo@@ crats will work together to get cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains reform this year 
 white house budget director rich@@ ard dar@@ man told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains cut in the final version of the bill 
 we do n't need this as a way to get capital gains he said 
 house budget committee chairman leon <@@ unk@@ > d. cali@@ f said in an interview if that 's the signal that comes from the white house that will help a great deal 
 the sen@@ ate 's decision was a set@@ back for president bush and will make approval of a cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains tax cut less certain this year 
 opponents of the cut are playing <@@ unk@@ > 
 sen@@ ate majority leader ge@@ or@@ ge mit@@ che@@ ll d. ma@@ ine said he was confident that any house-@@ sen@@ ate agreement on the defic@@ it-@@ reduction legislation would n't include a cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains tax cut 
 and a senior ai@@ de to the house ways and means committee where tax legislation <@@ unk@@ > said there are n't any plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year 
 one obvious place to <@@ unk@@ > a cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains tax cut and perhaps other popular items stri@@ pped from the defic@@ it-@@ reduction bill is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit 
 such legislation must be en@@ acted by the end of the month 
 the sen@@ ate bill was <@@ unk@@ > back in an attempt to speed defic@@ it-@@ reduction through congress 
 because the legislation has n't been completed president bush has until midnight tonight to en@@ act acro@@ ss@@ -@@ the-@@ board spending cuts mand@@ ated by the gramm@@ -@@ rud@@ man defic@@ it-@@ reduction law 
 sen@@ ators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree to the <@@ unk@@ > bill 
 the house appears reluctant to join the sen@@ ators 
 a key is whether house re@@ publi@@ cans are willing to <@@ unk@@ > to their sen@@ ate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet pro@@ visions 
 although i am encouraged by the sen@@ ate action said chairman dan <@@ unk@@ > d. ill of the house ways and means committee it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the <@@ unk@@ > conference with the sen@@ ate 
 another big question <@@ unk@@ > over the debate is what president bush thinks 
 he has been <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > bill without a guaranteed vote on his cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains tax cut 
 but re@@ publi@@ can sen@@ ators saw no way to overcome a proce@@ d@@ ural hur@@ dle and <@@ unk@@ > the N votes needed to win the cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains issue on the floor so they went ahead with the <@@ unk@@ > bill 
 the sen@@ ate bill was stri@@ pped of many popular though <@@ unk@@ > pro@@ visions a number of which are included in the house-@@ passed bill 
 these include a child-care initiative and <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > tax breaks for low-@@ income housing and <@@ unk@@ > expenditures 
 also missing from the sen@@ ate bill is the house 's repe@@ al of a law called section N that <@@ unk@@ > companies to give <@@ unk@@ > workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives 
 one <@@ unk@@ > provision that was originally in the sen@@ ate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by chairman l@@ loy@@ d <@@ unk@@ > d. tex@@ as of the sen@@ ate finance committee to expand the deduc@@ tion for individual retirement accounts 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said he hopes the sen@@ ate will consider that measure soon 
 to the <@@ unk@@ > of some doctors the bill dropped a plan passed by the finance committee that would have <@@ unk@@ > the entire <@@ unk@@ > system under medic@@ are 
 to the <@@ unk@@ > of many low-@@ income people efforts to boost medic@@ aid funding especially in rural areas also were <@@ unk@@ > 
 asked why sen@@ ators were giving up so much new me@@ x@@ ico sen@@ . pe@@ te <@@ unk@@ > the ranking re@@ publi@@ can on the sen@@ ate budget committee said we 're looking like <@@ unk@@ > 
 things had just gone too far 
 sen@@ . do@@ le said that the move required sacrifice by every sen@@ ator 
 it worked others said because there were no exceptions all <@@ unk@@ > pro@@ visions were <@@ unk@@ > 
 the sen@@ ate also dropped a plan by its finance committee that would have increased the income <@@ unk@@ > beyond which senior citizens have their social security benefits reduced 
 in addition the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a N N <@@ unk@@ > tax on long-distance telephone calls 
 it no longer includes a plan that would have <@@ unk@@ > what remains of the <@@ unk@@ > method of accounting which is used by military contrac@@ tors to reduce their tax burden 
 it also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current <@@ unk@@ > 
 also <@@ unk@@ > was a <@@ unk@@ > increase in the maximum <@@ unk@@ > safety and health administration pen@@ alties which would have raised $ N million in fiscal N 
 a provision that would have made the social security administration an independent agency was <@@ unk@@ > 
 the approval of the sen@@ ate bill was especially sweet for sen@@ . mit@@ che@@ ll who had proposed the strea@@ m@@ lining 
 m@@ r@@ . mit@@ che@@ ll 's relations with budget director dar@@ man who pushed for a cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains cut to be added to the measure have been <@@ unk@@ > since m@@ r@@ . dar@@ man chose to <@@ unk@@ > the ma@@ ine demo@@ cr@@ at and deal with other law@@ makers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal N supple@@ mental spending bill 
 the deficit reduction bill contains $ N billion in tax increases in fiscal N and $ N billion over five years 
 the <@@ unk@@ > pro@@ visions which affect mostly corporations would 
 prevent companies that have made le@@ ver@@ aged bu@@ y-@@ outs from getting federal tax re@@ funds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the bu@@ y-@@ outs effective au@@ g. N N 
 require mutual funds to include in their tax@@ able income divi@@ d@@ ends paid to them on the date that the divi@@ d@@ ends are declared rather than received effective the day after the tax bill is en@@ acted 
 close a <@@ unk@@ > regarding employee stock ownership plans effective j@@ une N N that has been <@@ unk@@ > by investment ban@@ kers in corporate take@@ overs 
 the measure <@@ unk@@ > a N N exclu@@ sion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securi@@ ties for an <@@ unk@@ > if the <@@ unk@@ > owns less than N N of the employer 's stock 
 curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securi@@ ties such as zer@@ o-@@ coupon bonds that postpone cash interest payments

 increase to $ N a person from $ N the international <@@ unk@@ > departure tax and impose a $ <@@ unk@@ > tax on international depar@@ tures by commercial ships 
 the measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees 
 among its pro@@ visions 
 reduction of medic@@ are spending in fiscal N by some $ N billion in part by cur@@ bing increases in <@@ unk@@ > to phys@@ icians 
 the plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year

 just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks wall street suffered another severe attack of nerves 
 does this signal another black monday is coming 
 or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity just like oc@@ t. N N eventually turned out to be 
 here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about friday 's action what happens next and what investors should do 
 jo@@ seph <@@ unk@@ > 
 i 'm the only one who said there would be an oc@@ to@@ ber massac@@ re all through late au@@ gust and september says m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > once a widely followed market <@@ unk@@ > and still a well-known new@@ sle@@ tter writer 
 everyone will tell you that this time is different from N he says 
 well in some ways it is different but technically it is just the same 
 if you 're a <@@ unk@@ > you <@@ unk@@ > the signals 
 right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out 
 i see no major support until N 
 i see a possibility of going to N this month 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says he would n't even think of buying until at least N to N stocks have hit 5@@ 2-@@ week lows about N stocks hit new lows friday 
 most people he says have no idea what a massac@@ re pattern looks like 
 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 a <@@ unk@@ > analy@@ st with sh@@ ear@@ son le@@ hman hu@@ tton inc@@ . m@@ s. <@@ unk@@ > had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the N crash 
 friday 's big drop she says was not a crash 
 this was an oc@@ to@@ ber massac@@ re like those that occurred in N and N 
 now as in those two years her stock market indic@@ ators are positive 
 so she thinks the damage will be short-@@ lived and contained 
 those <@@ unk@@ > lasted one to four weeks and took the market N N down she says 
 this is exactly the same thing as far as i 'm concerned 
 thus she says if the d@@ ow j@@ ones industrial average dropped below N it would just be a <@@ unk@@ > 
 my advice is to buy 
 as she <@@ unk@@ > it the average stock now sells for about N times companies ' earnings 
 she says that ratio could climb to N given current interest rates and still be within the range of fair value 
 <@@ unk@@ > da@@ vis 
 friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market says m@@ r@@ . da@@ vis president of <@@ unk@@ > da@@ vis research in@@ c 
 but m@@ r@@ . da@@ vis whose views are widely respected by money managers says he expects no <@@ unk@@ > crash 
 there was a unique combination in N he says 
 margin debt was at a record high 
 there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds 
 the main thing was portfolio insurance a mechanical trading system intended to protect an invest@@ or against losses 
 a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it 
 in N such selling contributed to a <@@ unk@@ > effect 
 today could even be an up day m@@ r@@ . da@@ vis says if major bro@@ ker@@ age firms agree to <@@ unk@@ > from program trading 
 over the next several months though he says things look bad 
 i think the market will be heading down into nove@@ mber he says 
 we will probably have a year-end rally and then go down again 
 sort of a <@@ unk@@ > bear market 
 he expects the downturn to carry the d@@ ow j@@ ones industrial average down to around N sometime next year 
 that would be a normal bear market he says 
 i guess that 's my forecast 
 leon g. <@@ unk@@ > 
 i do n't think the market is going through another oc@@ to@@ ber <@@ unk@@ > 
 i do n't think that 's the case at all says m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > a partner at gold@@ man s@@ achs & co@@ . and chairman of gold@@ man s@@ achs asset management 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > sees this as a good time to pick up bar@@ gains but he does n't think there 's any need to rush 
 i expect the market to open weaker monday but then it should find some stability 
 he <@@ unk@@ > off several major differences between now and two years ago 
 unlike N interest rates have been falling this year 
 unlike N the dollar has been strong 
 and unlike N the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of <@@ unk@@ > 
 but the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits is n't good he says 
 so it 's a very mixed bag 
 thus he conclud@@ es this is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks 
 if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the port@@ foli@@ os i would not do any buying 
 but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio so i would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients 
 we 're going to look for some of the <@@ unk@@ > companies that got <@@ unk@@ > friday 
 jo@@ hn ken@@ ne@@ th <@@ unk@@ > 
 this is the latest <@@ unk@@ > of the capacity of the financial community for <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > says m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > an economist 
 i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion he says 
 the explosion of junk bonds and take@@ overs has <@@ unk@@ > a lot of <@@ unk@@ > securi@@ ties in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the <@@ unk@@ > of take@@ overs or feared take@@ overs with huge amounts of debt rather than equ@@ ity 
 this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable 
 nevertheless he says a depression does n't appear likely 
 there is more <@@ unk@@ > in the economy at large than we commonly <@@ unk@@ > he says 
 it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the <@@ unk@@ > much as the financial community and the government may try 
 mari@@ o <@@ unk@@ > 
 new y@@ ork money manager mari@@ o <@@ unk@@ > an expert at <@@ unk@@ > take@@ over candidates says that take@@ overs are n't totally gone 
 companies are still going to buy companies around the world he says 
 examples are ford looking at j@@ agu@@ ar bell@@ south looking at lin broadcasting 
 these sorts of take@@ overs do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them so m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > figures they will continue 
 the market was up N N since president bush took office m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says so a correction was to be expected 
 he thinks another crash is unlikely and says he was <@@ unk@@ > at selected stocks during friday 's plun@@ ge 
 stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity this week for guys like me he says 
 ji@@ m ro@@ gers 
 it seems to me that this is the <@@ unk@@ > that has finally <@@ unk@@ > the balloon says m@@ r@@ . ro@@ gers a professor of finance at colu@@ mb@@ ia university and former <@@ unk@@ > of one of the most successful he@@ dge funds in history quantum fund 
 he sees economic problems financial problems ahead for the u@@ .s@@ . with a fairly strong possibility of a recession 
 friday you could n't sell dollars he says 
 dealers would give you a quote but then refuse to make the trade 
 if the dollar stays weak he says that will add to <@@ unk@@ > pressures in the u@@ .s@@ . and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much 
 m@@ r@@ . ro@@ gers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go 
 he recommends that investors sell <@@ unk@@ > stocks but hang on to some other stocks especially utilities which often do well during periods of economic weakness 
 frank <@@ unk@@ > 
 many people now claim to have predicted the N crash 
 <@@ unk@@ > new@@ sle@@ tter writer fr@@ anc@@ is <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > actually did it he stated in writing in september N that the d@@ ow j@@ ones industrial average was likely to decline about N points the following month 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says what happens now will depend a good deal on the federal reserve board 
 if it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks he says that could quiet things down 
 if not we could go to N very soon 
 frank w@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 
 stock prices would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks says m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > president and managing director of ren@@ aissance investment management inc@@ . in c@@ inc@@ in@@ na@@ ti 
 ren@@ aissance which manages about $ N billion drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally 
 ren@@ aissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equi@@ val@@ ents primarily u@@ .s@@ . treas@@ ury bills 
 <@@ unk@@ > probably are the right place to be he says 
 regarding the oc@@ t. N letter to the editor from rep@@ . tom <@@ unk@@ > chairman of the house sub@@ committee on employment and housing alle@@ ging 
 N that your sep@@ t. N editorial <@@ unk@@ > commit@@ tees was <@@ unk@@ > inaccurate and deliberately misleading 
 i thought your editorial was <@@ unk@@ > accurate and deliberately <@@ unk@@ > 
 N that m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > supported the rights of the wit@@ nesses to take the fifth amend@@ ment 
 yes he did 
 as i watched him on <@@ unk@@ > i heard him speak those lovely words about the bill of rights which he quotes from the <@@ unk@@ > of the hear@@ ings 
 he did repeat those nice <@@ unk@@ > several times as an indication of his support for the constitution 
 he used about N words defending the wit@@ nesses ' constitu@@ tional rights 
 unfortunately by my rough guess he used better than N words <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > on the wit@@ nesses for exercising the fifth 
 he <@@ unk@@ > his <@@ unk@@ > of constitu@@ tional meat between large <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > comment@@ ary 
 as your editorial <@@ unk@@ > pointed out sa@@ mu@@ el <@@ unk@@ > former hu@@ d secretary and <@@ unk@@ > wil@@ son m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 's former ai@@ de are currently being held up to <@@ unk@@ > for taking the fifth amend@@ ment 
 that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 
 N that his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hu@@ d 
 my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court etc 
 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 by any reasonable man <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convic@@ ted 
 apparently their ver@@ dic@@ t is in 
 right now they 're pursuing evidence 
 that 's not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice 
 how was that practice referred to when i was in school 
 <@@ unk@@ > yes something called a star chamber 
 of course m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > protest that his sub@@ committee simply seeks information for legi@@ sla@@ tive change 
 no doubt that 's partially true 
 everything that m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says in his letter is partially true 
 he 's right about his sub@@ committee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hu@@ d officials 
 but if his explanation of <@@ unk@@ > is true why is his investigation so <@@ unk@@ > as to identify criminal activity 
 why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and <@@ unk@@ > 
 such as what happened when congress wanted to know about $ N toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost 
 no m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 's complaints simply wo n't wash 
 N that the journal <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > fraud waste <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and abuse of the public that took place while m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > was secretary of hu@@ d etc. and so forth 
 no to my mind the journal did not defend <@@ unk@@ > fraud waste <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and abuse of the public trust 
 it def@@ ended appropriate constitu@@ tional <@@ unk@@ > and practical common sense 
 the problem which the journal so <@@ unk@@ > pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a <@@ unk@@ > body 
 of course we 've also got a jud@@ ici@@ ary that seeks the same objective 
 the system is the problem not an individual member 
 individuals can always have their hands <@@ unk@@ > 
 it 's when such <@@ unk@@ > does n't occur that we 've got trouble 
 i do not by any means defend hu@@ d management 
 but i think the kind of con@@ gre@@ ssional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to american <@@ unk@@ > of liberty and freedom than any <@@ unk@@ > and yes maybe <@@ unk@@ > within hu@@ d could possibly generate 
 the last time i saw a similar con@@ gre@@ ssional hearing was when <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > jo@@ e <@@ unk@@ > did his work 
 ra@@ y@@ mond <@@ unk@@ > 
 <@@ unk@@ > n.@@ j 
 i disagree with the statement by m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > that one should not draw an adverse <@@ unk@@ > against former hu@@ d officials who <@@ unk@@ > their fifth amend@@ ment privilege against <@@ unk@@ > in con@@ gre@@ ssional hear@@ ings 
 the fifth amend@@ ment states in relevant part that no person shall be <@@ unk@@ > in any criminal case to be a witness against himself 
 this privilege against <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > the drawing of an adverse <@@ unk@@ > against a criminal def@@ end@@ ant who chooses not to testi@@ fy 
 thus in a criminal case a prosecu@@ tor can not comment on a def@@ end@@ ant 's failure to testi@@ fy nor can the def@@ end@@ ant be <@@ unk@@ > to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the fifth 
 the privilege however has been limited in <@@ unk@@ > with its plain language to protect the def@@ end@@ ant in criminal matters only 
 the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth amend@@ ment does not pre@@ clud@@ e the <@@ unk@@ > where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause 
 <@@ unk@@ > v@@ . <@@ unk@@ > N u@@ .s@@ . N N 
 thus in a civil case a def@@ end@@ ant may be called as a witness he may be forced to testi@@ fy or take the fifth and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse <@@ unk@@ > against him in the civil matter 
 he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and <@@ unk@@ > belief that his testi@@ mony may subject him to criminal prosecu@@ tion 
 allowing the def@@ end@@ ant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitu@@ tional right to refuse to testi@@ fy where one 's testi@@ mony <@@ unk@@ > him in the civil matter but because the testi@@ mony in the civil matter could be <@@ unk@@ > used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecu@@ tion 
 <@@ unk@@ > the risk of such prosecu@@ tion a court may order the def@@ end@@ ant to testi@@ fy 
 thus when m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > as@@ serted the fifth in a <@@ unk@@ > proce@@ eding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal coun@@ sel one must conclude that he held a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > belief that his testi@@ mony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecu@@ tion 
 the sub@@ committee congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse <@@ unk@@ > and to <@@ unk@@ > with m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 's own belief that his testi@@ mony could help <@@ unk@@ > him of a crime 
 drawing the adverse <@@ unk@@ > in a <@@ unk@@ > con@@ gre@@ ssional hearing does not <@@ unk@@ > the fifth amend@@ ment shield against <@@ unk@@ >

 in <@@ unk@@ > a so-called friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors 
 ro@@ bert <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > professors of finance at the university of mi@@ ami found evidence that the market is sp@@ oo@@ ked by friday the 13th 
 but their study which <@@ unk@@ > the N period has since been shown to be <@@ unk@@ > by an <@@ unk@@ > choice of data 
 in the <@@ unk@@ > the market took falls nine times in a row on friday the <@@ unk@@ > 
 but the date tends to be a plus not a minus for stocks according to y@@ ale <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > of stock market <@@ unk@@ > 
 another study found that the N <@@ unk@@ > the 13th in the N period had higher than average returns higher even than <@@ unk@@ > in general which tend to be strong days for stock prices 
 on the only other friday the 13th this year the d@@ ow j@@ ones industrial average rose about four points 
 professor <@@ unk@@ > says the original study titled friday the 13th part <@@ unk@@ > was published <@@ unk@@ > 
 in a similar <@@ unk@@ > he adds that the anniversary of the N crash and saturday 's full moon could have played a part too in friday 's market activity 
 <@@ unk@@ > of those during the N crash that as stock prices plu@@ mme@@ ted and trading activity <@@ unk@@ > some phone calls to market makers in over-@@ the-@@ counter stocks went <@@ unk@@ > 
 we could n't get dealers to answer their phones said ro@@ bert king senior vice president of ot@@ c trading at <@@ unk@@ > co@@ . in at@@ l@@ anta 
 it was like the friday before black monday two years ago 
 whether <@@ unk@@ > phone calls had any effect or not nas@@ da@@ q stocks sank far less than those on the new y@@ ork and american exchanges 
 nonetheless the nas@@ da@@ q compo@@ site index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever <@@ unk@@ > N or N N to N 
 ten points of the drop occurred during the last N minutes of trading 
 by comparison the new y@@ ork stock exchange compo@@ site tu@@ mbled N N friday and the american stock exchange compo@@ site fell N N 
 on oc@@ t. N N the nas@@ da@@ q compo@@ site fell N points or N N followed by its devastating <@@ unk@@ > or N N slide three days later 
 nas@@ da@@ q volume friday total@@ ed N million shares which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year 
 the <@@ unk@@ > record of N million shares was set on oc@@ t. N 
 there was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved said <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > president of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > a new y@@ ork company that makes markets in thousands of ot@@ c issues 
 most of the complaints about <@@ unk@@ > phone calls came from regional bro@@ kers rather than individual investors 
 m@@ r@@ . king of <@@ unk@@ > and others were quick to add that they believe the problem ste@@ mmed more from tra@@ ders ' inability to handle the volume of calls rather than a <@@ unk@@ > attempt to avoid making tra@@ des 
 the subject is a <@@ unk@@ > one for nas@@ da@@ q and its <@@ unk@@ > companies which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their bro@@ kers or trade in the chaos of the crash 
 pe@@ ter d@@ ap@@ u@@ zz@@ o head of retail equ@@ ity trading at sh@@ ear@@ son le@@ hman hu@@ tton declared it was the last hour of trading on a friday 
 there were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots 
 it was n't <@@ unk@@ > we were all busy 
 ja@@ mes <@@ unk@@ > head of ot@@ c trading at ha@@ mb@@ re@@ ch@@ t & qui@@ st in san fr@@ anci@@ sco said it was just like two years ago 
 everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time 
 <@@ unk@@ > mul@@ l@@ ins the ot@@ c trading chief at de@@ an wi@@ tter re@@ y@@ no@@ l@@ ds in new y@@ ork said <@@ unk@@ > that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading 
 but he added you can only take one call at a time 
 market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbal@@ ances occur 
 on days like friday that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to 
 when selling is so <@@ unk@@ > prices fall <@@ unk@@ > and fast 
 two years ago faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their invent@@ ories market makers themselves began <@@ unk@@ > shares <@@ unk@@ > the slide in ot@@ c stock prices 
 on friday some market makers were selling again tra@@ ders said 
 but with profits s@@ ag@@ ging on wall street since the crash companies have kept smaller share <@@ unk@@ > on hand 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > of ha@@ mb@@ re@@ ch@@ t & qui@@ st said some prices fell without tra@@ des taking place as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares 
 everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid he said 
 so while ot@@ c companies incurred losses on friday trading officials said the damage was n't as bad as it was in N 
 two years ago we were carrying huge invent@@ ories and that was the big <@@ unk@@ > 
 i do n't know of anyone carrying big invent@@ ories now said m@@ r@@ . king of <@@ unk@@ > 
 ton@@ y <@@ unk@@ > head of equ@@ ity trading at <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > & <@@ unk@@ > in min@@ ne@@ ap@@ olis said that <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > actually made money on friday 
 it helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago he said 
 jo@@ seph <@@ unk@@ > president of the national association of securi@@ ties dealers which over@@ sees the nas@@ da@@ q computer@@ ized trading system said that despite the rush of selling he never considered the situation an emergency 
 the pace of trading was orderly he said 
 nas@@ da@@ q 's small order execution system worked <@@ unk@@ > as did the automated system for larger tra@@ des according to m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 
 nevertheless the shock of another steep plun@@ ge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence 
 in the past the ot@@ c market <@@ unk@@ > on a firm base of <@@ unk@@ > participation 
 because nas@@ da@@ q 's trading volume has n't returned to <@@ unk@@ > levels tra@@ ders and ot@@ c market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent 
 but they are worried 
 we were just starting to get the public 's confidence back <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . mul@@ l@@ ins of de@@ an wi@@ tter 
 more troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently ero@@ de the base of <@@ unk@@ > support the ot@@ c market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the oc@@ to@@ ber N crash 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > says some action from government policy makers would <@@ unk@@ > invest@@ or fears 
 it wo n't take much more to scare the hell out of retail investors he says 
 the sellers on friday came from all corners of the ot@@ c market big and small institu@@ tional investors as well as individual investors and market makers 
 but <@@ unk@@ > tra@@ ders said the sell orders generally ranged from N shares to N shares compared with blocks of N shares or more two years ago 
 sh@@ ear@@ son 's m@@ r@@ . d@@ ap@@ u@@ zz@@ o said retail investors nerv@@ ously sold stock friday and never returned to <@@ unk@@ > 
 institu@@ tional investors which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in <@@ unk@@ > gains made through the third quarter were <@@ unk@@ > 
 we had a good amount of selling from institutions but not as much panic m@@ r@@ . d@@ ap@@ u@@ zz@@ o said 
 if they could n't sell some of them put the shares back on the shelf 
 in addition he said some bigger institu@@ tional investors placed bi@@ ds to buy some ot@@ c stocks whose prices were beaten down 
 in addition m@@ r@@ . d@@ ap@@ u@@ zz@@ o said computer-@@ guided program selling of ot@@ c stocks in the r@@ us@@ sell index of N small stocks and the standard & poor 's 500@@ -@@ stock index sent <@@ unk@@ > waves through the market

 and they plan to buy more today 
 <@@ unk@@ > or <@@ unk@@ > many giant institu@@ tional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the oc@@ to@@ ber N crash buying at the bottom pays off 
 to be sure big investors might put away their <@@ unk@@ > in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today 
 they could still panic and ba@@ il out of the market 
 but their N performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse 
 last time we got <@@ unk@@ > for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst said jo@@ hn w@@ . ro@@ gers president of chic@@ ag@@ o-@@ based <@@ unk@@ > capital management inc@@ . which manages $ N billion of stocks

 i waited to make sure all the program tra@@ des had kicked through he said 
 then he jumped into the market 
 i spent $ N million in the last half-@@ hour 
 other money managers also opened their <@@ unk@@ > 
 i was buying at the close friday and i 'll be buying again because i know we 're getting good value said fre@@ der@@ ick a@@ . <@@ unk@@ > president of <@@ unk@@ > asset management inc@@ . green@@ wich con@@ n 
 there is no <@@ unk@@ > on the fundamental level for this crash 
 unlike mutual funds which can be forced to sell <@@ unk@@ > when investors rush to withdraw money big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market <@@ unk@@ > without <@@ unk@@ > stock 
 most often they do just that because stocks have proved to be the <@@ unk@@ > long-term investment attracting about $ N trillion from pension funds alone 
 if you bought after the crash you did very very well off the bottom said step@@ hen b@@ . <@@ unk@@ > chief investment officer of chic@@ ag@@ o-@@ based ke@@ mper financial services in@@ c 
 the $ N billion cali@@ for@@ nia public employees retirement system for one added $ N billion to its stock portfolio two years ago 
 the last crash taught institu@@ tional investors that they have to be long-term holders and that they ca n't react to short-term events good or bad said step@@ hen l@@ . <@@ unk@@ > senior vice president for the pension consul@@ tants <@@ unk@@ > associates in s@@ anta <@@ unk@@ > cali@@ f 
 those that pulled out of stocks <@@ unk@@ > it he said so i doubt you 'll see any significant changes in institu@@ tional port@@ foli@@ os as a result of friday 's decline 
 stocks as measured by the standard & poor 's 500@@ -@@ stock index have been <@@ unk@@ > performers this year rising N N before friday 's plun@@ ge excluding divi@@ d@@ ends 
 even friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than N N well above the annual average for stocks over several decades 
 you could go down N points and still have a good year in the market said ja@@ mes d. <@@ unk@@ > president of new y@@ or@@ k-@@ based <@@ unk@@ > capital cor@@ p 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > however worries that the market could go down N or N points in the next few days 
 it can happen before you can turn around 
 he said he <@@ unk@@ > many paralle@@ ls with N including the emphasis on take@@ over stocks and the <@@ unk@@ > of computer@@ ized program trading 
 the only thing you do n't have he said is the portfolio insurance phenomenon <@@ unk@@ > on the rest 
 most institu@@ tional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance he@@ d@@ ging technique which is widely thought to have <@@ unk@@ > the N crash 
 not really insurance this <@@ unk@@ > was designed to sof@@ ten the blow of declining stock prices and generate an off@@ setting profit by selling waves of s@@ &@@ p futures contracts 
 in its <@@ unk@@ > test the $ N billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the N crash did n't work as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became <@@ unk@@ > 
 even without portfolio insurance market conditions were gri@@ m friday money managers said 
 ne@@ il <@@ unk@@ > whose new y@@ or@@ k-@@ based <@@ unk@@ > capital partners had converted N N of its $ N million investment pool to cash in recent months said he was be@@ si@@ e@@ ged by wall street firms friday asking him to take stock off their hands

 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > predic@@ ts stocks will appear to stabi@@ lize in the next few days before declining again <@@ unk@@ > more investors 
 i think it will be a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > rally he said 
 meanwhile friday brought a <@@ unk@@ > for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally

 chase man@@ hattan bank chairman <@@ unk@@ > but@@ cher is a conservative banker and a loyal re@@ publi@@ can but on friday morning he had few kind words for president bush 's economic <@@ unk@@ > 
 there are some very significant issues out there such as the fiscal deficit the trade deficit our relations with japan that have to be the subject of major initiatives he said in an interview 
 i 'd like to see that initiative and i have n't 
 there is n't a big shot an agenda 
 a few hours later the stock market dropped N points 
 politicians tried to finger each other for the blame although many analy@@ sts doubt that wash@@ ington was <@@ unk@@ > responsible for wall street 's w@@ oes 
 but m@@ r@@ . but@@ cher 's comments make one thing clear some on wall street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy 
 consider this 
 by N p.m. tonight president bush must order $ N billion of automatic acro@@ ss@@ -@@ the-@@ board cuts in government spending to comply with the gramm@@ -@@ rud@@ man budget law 
 the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a <@@ unk@@ > bill 
 we simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices house budget committee chairman leon <@@ unk@@ > d. cali@@ f said yesterday on nb@@ c news 's meet the press 
 for the last two weeks the bush administration and the federal reserve have been engaged in a <@@ unk@@ > battle over international economic policy 
 the administration has been trying to push the dollar lower the fed has been <@@ unk@@ > 
 one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary <@@ unk@@ > between the treas@@ ury department and the federal reserve board said la@@ wr@@ ence <@@ unk@@ > a bear st@@ earns & co@@ . economist on ab@@ c 's this week 
 the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent sp@@ ate of airline take@@ overs 
 last month transportation secretary sam skin@@ ner forced northwest airlines to reduce a stake held by <@@ unk@@ > royal du@@ tch airlines 
 but he has since run into opposition from the treas@@ ury and the white house over that decision 
 and he has kept <@@ unk@@ > on how his decision might affect a bid for united airlines which includes a big stake by british air@@ ways pl@@ c 
 some analy@@ sts say uncertainty about wash@@ ington 's anti-@@ take@@ over policy was one reason that financing for the united airlines take@@ over fell through the event that triggered the market drop 
 in many ways the back@@ drop to friday 's stock decline is <@@ unk@@ > similar to that of oc@@ to@@ ber N 's <@@ unk@@ > crash 
 then as now the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold 
 the treas@@ ury was locked in a battle over international economic policy although at that time it was with west german officials rather than the federal reserve 
 and concern about official actions aimed at take@@ overs then by the <@@ unk@@ > house ways and means committee rather than the transportation department were making markets nervous 
 the N crash brought the re@@ ag@@ an administration and democratic law@@ makers to the table for the first budget summit resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ N billion even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ N billion during that period 
 but bar@@ ring further drops in the market this week a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year 
 law@@ makers and administration officials agree that friday 's drop by itself is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a defic@@ it-@@ reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-@@ reaching than last spring 's <@@ unk@@ > plan which still is n't fully implemented 
 one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that as everyone learned in N the economy and the market can survive a one-day <@@ unk@@ > tu@@ mble 
 everybody thought we were looking at a <@@ unk@@ > of N that we were looking at a recession rep@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said yesterday in an interview 
 that did not happen 
 they learned they could survive it without much problem 
 but administration officials privately agree with m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > who said a <@@ unk@@ > drop this week is going to force the president and congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy 
 in that case there will be plenty of blame to go around 
 there is an under@@ lying concern on the part of the american people and there should be that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut said sen@@ ate finance committee chairman l@@ loy@@ d <@@ unk@@ > d. tex@@ as 
 nevertheless it clearly will take more than friday 's 190@@ -@@ point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between law@@ makers and white house budget director rich@@ ard dar@@ man over the cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains fight 
 hill demo@@ crats are particularly angry over m@@ r@@ . bush 's claim that the cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains cut was part of april 's budget accor@@ d and his insi@@ stence on combining it with the defic@@ it-@@ reduction legislation 
 there is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal sen@@ ate majority leader ge@@ or@@ ge mit@@ che@@ ll d. ma@@ ine said yesterday on c@@ bs news 's face the nation 
 during last week 's <@@ unk@@ > on the <@@ unk@@ > bill and the cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains issue there were signs that sen@@ ate re@@ publi@@ cans and the administration were at odds 
 at the very moment that sen@@ ate re@@ publi@@ cans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the defic@@ it-@@ reduction legislation white house spo@@ kes@@ man mar@@ lin fit@@ z@@ water told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it 
 when an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation ore@@ gon sen@@ . bob pack@@ wood the ranking g@@ op member of the <@@ unk@@ > sen@@ ate finance committee ha@@ iled it 
 asked if the administration agreed he <@@ unk@@ > replied the <@@ unk@@ > will have to speak for itself 
 friday 's market tu@@ mble could sp@@ ur action on <@@ unk@@ > the house and sen@@ ate versions of the defic@@ it-@@ reduction measure a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the <@@ unk@@ > 
 sen@@ ate re@@ publi@@ cans expressed the hope that the house would follow the lead of the sen@@ ate which on friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal N deficit 
 the market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction and the best way to do that is for the house of representatives to strip their bill of similar pro@@ visions sen@@ . war@@ ren <@@ unk@@ > r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said yesterday 
 the white house office of management and budget whose calculations determine whether the gramm@@ -@@ rud@@ man targets are met estimated that the house-@@ passed defic@@ it-@@ reduction measure would cut the fiscal N <@@ unk@@ > by $ N billion almost half of the con@@ gre@@ ssional budget office 's estimate of $ N billion 
 rep@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said that <@@ unk@@ > 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent acro@@ ss@@ -@@ the-@@ board cuts but added we 're getting very close to the mar@@ gins here 
 no one in wash@@ ington was willing to take the blame for <@@ unk@@ > friday 's drop in the stock market 
 but some players were quick to seize the moment 
 before the sun had set on friday rich@@ ard <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > chief economist of the u@@ .s@@ . chamber of commerce issued a statement <@@ unk@@ > the drop in stock prices to the sen@@ ate decision to postpone action on capital gains 
 investors who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell were sp@@ oo@@ ked he said 
 there have been many <@@ unk@@ > reasons advanced to support a cap@@ it@@ al-@@ gains tax cut sen@@ . mit@@ che@@ ll said during his television appearance but i suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others

 small investors matched their big institu@@ tional <@@ unk@@ > in anxiety over the weekend but most seemed to be taking a <@@ unk@@ > approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market 
 i 'm not losing faith in the market said bo@@ ston lawyer chri@@ stop@@ her sul@@ li@@ van as he watched the market plun@@ ge on a big screen in front of a bro@@ ker@@ age firm 
 but he 's not so sure about everyone else 
 i think on monday the small investors are going to panic and sell predicted m@@ r@@ . sul@@ li@@ van whose investments include am@@ r cor@@ p. 's american airlines unit and several mutual funds 
 and i think institutions are going to come in and buy 
 i 'm going to hold on 
 if i sell now i 'll take a big loss 
 some <@@ unk@@ > an optimi@@ sm that had been <@@ unk@@ > when they did n't <@@ unk@@ > the market in N 
 oh i bet it 'll be up N points on monday said <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > retired <@@ unk@@ > in lex@@ ington <@@ unk@@ > 
 m@@ r@@ s. <@@ unk@@ > said her <@@ unk@@ > investment club 's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the black monday crash but no one got discouraged and we gained that back and more 
 at the annual congress of the national association of investors cor@@ p. at the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > hotel in min@@ ne@@ ap@@ olis the scene was calm 
 some N investors representing invest@@ or clubs from around the u@@ .s@@ . were attending when the market started to slide friday 
 but ro@@ bert <@@ unk@@ > an official of the association said no special <@@ unk@@ > or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned 
 in fact some of the association 's members long-term <@@ unk@@ > investors welcomed the drop in prices 
 we hope to take advantage of it said jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > a member of a los angel@@ es investors ' club 
 he has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants 
 not everyone is reacting so <@@ unk@@ > however and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of friday 's slide reluct@@ ance by banks to provide financing for a bu@@ y-@@ out of u@@ al cor@@ p. parent of united airlines 
 mar@@ c <@@ unk@@ > a ta@@ mp@@ a fla@@ . investment banker said the market drop is one of a tremendous number of signs that the le@@ ver@@ aged <@@ unk@@ > era is ending 
 there 's no question that there 's a general <@@ unk@@ > for le@@ verage among len@@ ders 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > believes however that the market could be stabi@@ lized if cali@@ for@@ nia invest@@ or mar@@ vin da@@ vis steps back in to the united bi@@ dding with an offer of $ N a share 
 <@@ unk@@ > al@@ bert a <@@ unk@@ > dal@@ las law student says she 's generally <@@ unk@@ > about the stock market and the take@@ over activity that seems to fuel it 
 i have this feeling that it 's built on sand she says that the market rises but there 's no foundation to it 
 she and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the N crash although she still owns some tex@@ ac@@ o stock 
 partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school i think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid 
 others wonder how many more of these shocks the small invest@@ or can stand 
 we all assumed oc@@ to@@ ber <@@ unk@@ > was a one-@@ time shot said san fr@@ anci@@ sco attorney da@@ vid green@@ berg 
 we told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime come on back 
 now it 's happening again 
 m@@ r@@ . green@@ berg got out just before the N crash and to his regret never went back even as the market so@@ ared 
 this time he 's ready to buy in when the panic wears off 
 still he adds we ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often 
 when the little guy gets frightened the big guys hurt badly 
 mer@@ ri@@ ll ly@@ n@@ ch ca n't survive without the little guy 
 small investors have <@@ unk@@ > back into the market following black monday but mostly through mutual funds 
 discount bro@@ ker@@ age customers have been in the market somewhat but not whole <@@ unk@@ > like they were two years ago says le@@ sli@@ e quick j@@ r@@ . chairman of the quick & <@@ unk@@ > discount bro@@ ker@@ age firm 
 hu@@ go <@@ unk@@ > senior vice president at char@@ les <@@ unk@@ > cor@@ p. says sch@@ wa@@ b customers have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks 
 individual investors are still angry about program trading m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says 
 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > a cor@@ ne@@ ll university finance professor says government regul@@ ators will have to more closely control program trading to win back the confidence of the small invest@@ or 
 but it 's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried 
 al@@ an <@@ unk@@ > general sales manager of a chr@@ ys@@ ler deal@@ ership in hou@@ ston said he and his mother have some joint stock investments but the overall economy is his chief worry 
 these high <@@ unk@@ > took a big <@@ unk@@ > today he said in his show@@ room which is within a few miles of the <@@ unk@@ > dollar homes of some of hou@@ ston 's <@@ unk@@ > citizens

 the crowded field for <@@ unk@@ > computers is about to become a lot more crowded 
 comp@@ a@@ q computer cor@@ p. 's long-@@ awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market especially z@@ eni@@ th electronics cor@@ p. the current market leader and on a <@@ unk@@ > of promising <@@ unk@@ > 
 comp@@ a@@ q 's series of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > a trend toward <@@ unk@@ > in the personal computer market 
 one manufacturer already has produced a <@@ unk@@ > computer called a <@@ unk@@ > and two others have introduced even smaller <@@ unk@@ > 
 but those machines are still considered <@@ unk@@ > with <@@ unk@@ > only a <@@ unk@@ > could love and screens to match 
 comp@@ a@@ q 's <@@ unk@@ > by contrast may be the first in their weight class not to <@@ unk@@ > on features found in much bigger machines 
 analy@@ sts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market and they 're priced aggressively at $ N to $ N 
 all of this comes in a machine that <@@ unk@@ > only six pounds and fits <@@ unk@@ > into most <@@ unk@@ > 
 in recent months comp@@ a@@ q 's competition including z@@ eni@@ th toshi@@ ba cor@@ p. tan@@ dy cor@@ p. and ne@@ c cor@@ p. all have introduced <@@ unk@@ > that weigh approximately the same and that are called <@@ unk@@ > perhaps <@@ unk@@ > 
 one analy@@ st no@@ ting that most such machines are about two inches thick takes exception to the name 
 this is n't quite a notebook i call it a <@@ unk@@ > he says 
 that ca n't be said of the $ N <@@ unk@@ > computer introduced a few weeks ago by gri@@ d systems cor@@ p. a unit of tan@@ dy 
 instead of a <@@ unk@@ > it features a writing surface an electronic <@@ unk@@ > and the ability to read block printing 
 at N N pounds it may be too <@@ unk@@ > named but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analy@@ sts <@@ unk@@ > 
 <@@ unk@@ > are n't far behind 
 <@@ unk@@ > cor@@ p. 's portfolio introduced in eur@@ ope two months ago and in the u@@ .s@@ . in early september <@@ unk@@ > less than a pound costs a mere $ N and runs on three <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > yet has the power to run some <@@ unk@@ > and word processing programs 
 some critics however say its ability to run <@@ unk@@ > programs is restricted by a limited memory 
 <@@ unk@@ > computer cor@@ p. meanwhile has introduced a much more sophisticated <@@ unk@@ > that can run lotus N and other sophisticated software programs but costs five times as much 
 at stake is what mi@@ ke <@@ unk@@ > comp@@ a@@ q 's president of north america operations calls the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > of the computer industry the search for a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere 
 the market is so new nobody knows yet how big it can be 
 i 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is says tom <@@ unk@@ > director of marketing for gri@@ d 
 whether it 's $ N billion or $ N billion it does n't matter 
 it 's huge 
 consider the growth of <@@ unk@@ > which now <@@ unk@@ > N N of all personal computer sales 
 <@@ unk@@ > generally anything under N pounds have become the fast@@ est-@@ growing personal computer segment with sales dou@@ bling this year 
 responding to that demand however has led to a variety of <@@ unk@@ > 
 making computers smaller often means <@@ unk@@ > memory 
 it also has <@@ unk@@ > use of the faster more powerful microp@@ ro@@ cess@@ ors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines 
 size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays 
 the competitive <@@ unk@@ > can get pretty <@@ unk@@ > at times 
 a <@@ unk@@ > spo@@ kes@@ man for example <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > portfolio because it requires three <@@ unk@@ > while the <@@ unk@@ > needs only two 
 both <@@ unk@@ > are dismissed by notebook makers who argue that they 're too small a problem <@@ unk@@ > also encountered in focus groups adm@@ its <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > director of marketing 
 <@@ unk@@ > trying to avoid the <@@ unk@@ > label responded with the tag line the <@@ unk@@ > pc a very big computer 
 despite the <@@ unk@@ > few question the <@@ unk@@ > of the move to small machines that do n't make <@@ unk@@ > 
 toward that end experts say the real battle will take place between <@@ unk@@ > players like toshi@@ ba z@@ eni@@ th and now comp@@ a@@ q 
 comp@@ a@@ q 's new machines are considered a direct threat to star@@ t-up firms like <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . which introduced in j@@ une a computer that like comp@@ a@@ q 's uses an in@@ tel N microp@@ ro@@ cess@@ or and has a hard disk drive 
 but the <@@ unk@@ > product is twice as heavy and costs more than comp@@ a@@ q 's 
 comp@@ a@@ q 's announcement also <@@ unk@@ > trouble for z@@ eni@@ th which last year had N N of the u@@ .s@@ . laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to ci@@ e. des machines bull the french govern@@ ment-@@ owned computer maker 
 z@@ eni@@ th holders will vote in dece@@ mber on the proposed $ N million sale a price that could slip because it is pe@@ gged to z@@ eni@@ th 's share and sales 
 comp@@ a@@ q is already taking aim at z@@ eni@@ th 's market share 
 rod <@@ unk@@ > comp@@ a@@ q 's president and chief executive officer notes <@@ unk@@ > that z@@ eni@@ th 's $ N <@@ unk@@ > uses an <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > disk <@@ unk@@ > comp@@ a@@ q 's new machines use the more common N <@@ unk@@ > disk 
 jo@@ hn p. frank president of z@@ eni@@ th data systems simply <@@ unk@@ > off such criticism no@@ ting that N <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > were also <@@ unk@@ > when they first replaced <@@ unk@@ > disks 
 we do n't look at it as not being a standard we look at it as a new standard he argues 
 analy@@ sts do n't see it that way 
 i ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is <@@ unk@@ > for comp@@ a@@ q and a <@@ unk@@ > for everyone else says gene <@@ unk@@ > president of professional marketing management in@@ c 
 adds bill <@@ unk@@ > senior industry analy@@ st for <@@ unk@@ > a high-@@ technology market research firm we basically think that these are very hot products 
 the problem comp@@ a@@ q is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them 
 comp@@ a@@ q 's machines include the N <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > disk drive a <@@ unk@@ > screen that is only <@@ unk@@ > thick and an internal expansion <@@ unk@@ > for a <@@ unk@@ > in other words almost all the <@@ unk@@ > of a typical office machine 
 others undoubtedly will follow but most analy@@ sts believe comp@@ a@@ q has at least a six-@@ month lead on the competition 
 toshi@@ ba 's line of <@@ unk@@ > for example features the <@@ unk@@ > which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory and the <@@ unk@@ > which also uses a N microp@@ ro@@ cess@@ or but which <@@ unk@@ > almost twice as much and is three times the size 
 a third model marke@@ ted in japan may hit the u@@ .s@@ . by the end of the first quarter of N but by then analy@@ sts say comp@@ a@@ q will have established itself as one of three major players 
 what about big blue

 ford motor co@@ . said it acquired N N of the shares in j@@ agu@@ ar pl@@ c 
 j@@ agu@@ ar the london stock exchange and the u@@ .s@@ . securi@@ ties and exchange commission are being notified of the transactions the company said 
 the u@@ .s@@ . federal trade commission advised ford last week that it would n't raise any <@@ unk@@ > to the acquisition of as much as N N of j@@ agu@@ ar shares

 investors who bought stock with borrowed money that is on margin may be more worried than most following friday 's market drop 
 that 's because their bro@@ kers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the col@@ lat@@ eral backing their loans 
 in oc@@ to@@ ber N these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the down@@ ward <@@ unk@@ > of the stock market 
 typically a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below N N of its original value 
 if the invest@@ or does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call the bro@@ ker@@ age firm may begin <@@ unk@@ > the securi@@ ties 
 but some big bro@@ ker@@ age firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls 
 margin calls since friday have been higher than usual but reasonable a spo@@ kes@@ man for sh@@ ear@@ son le@@ hman hu@@ tton inc@@ . said 
 mer@@ ri@@ ll ly@@ n@@ ch & co@@ . officials do n't expect margin calls to be as big a factor as in N because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin a spo@@ kes@@ man said 
 hu@@ go <@@ unk@@ > senior vice president at char@@ les sch@@ wa@@ b cor@@ p. the san <@@ unk@@ > discount bro@@ ker@@ age firm said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for sch@@ wa@@ b customers 
 he said sch@@ wa@@ b had increased margin requirements so customers have more of a cushion

 <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . following rival her@@ tz cor@@ p. 's lead said it is backing out of <@@ unk@@ > programs with three airlines

 but it remains involved in programs with am@@ r cor@@ p. 's american airlines unit and del@@ ta air lines 
 industry estimates put <@@ unk@@ > 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ N million and $ N million 
 a spo@@ kes@@ man for <@@ unk@@ > would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for far less than half of the total 
 budget rent a car cor@@ p. of chic@@ ago and national car rental systems inc@@ . of min@@ ne@@ ap@@ olis both said they had no plans to follow suit 
 in fact budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs in which <@@ unk@@ > earn <@@ unk@@ > miles and <@@ unk@@ > can get <@@ unk@@ > discounts 
 i can not see how this news by her@@ tz and <@@ unk@@ > can not benefit budget 's programs said bob wil@@ son budget 's vice president marketing planning 
 northwest and <@@ unk@@ > are two of the five airlines with which budget has agreements 
 national also <@@ unk@@ > in the northwest <@@ unk@@ > program along with four other airlines including del@@ ta and u@@ sa@@ ir group inc@@ . 's u@@ sa@@ ir unit

 at the time her@@ tz said its annual fees to those airlines amoun@@ ted to $ N million and that the value of re@@ deemed <@@ unk@@ > topped $ N million 
 analy@@ sts and competitors however doubt the numbers were that high 
 budget said its <@@ unk@@ > costs are substantially below <@@ unk@@ > 's level 
 ro@@ bert d. <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > vice president of marketing said the proliferation and costs attached to <@@ unk@@ > programs have significantly dimini@@ shed their value 
 this year has been difficult for both her@@ tz and <@@ unk@@ > said char@@ les <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > industry analy@@ st at alex brown & sons 
 they 've been looking to get their costs down and this is a fairly <@@ unk@@ > way to do it he said

 c@@ bs insisted the move was n't a set@@ back for the program which is the network 's first entry into the <@@ unk@@ > talk show format since N 
 i have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it said rod <@@ unk@@ > who was named vice president of late night entertainment in au@@ gust 
 this will raise the energy level of the show

 tan@@ de@@ m computers inc@@ . preparing to fight with international business machines cor@@ p. for a piece of the main@@ frame business said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended sep@@ t. N 
 tan@@ de@@ m said it expects to report revenue of about $ N million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share 
 the results which are in line with analy@@ sts ' estimates reflect a continued improvement in our u@@ .s@@ . business said ja@@ mes <@@ unk@@ > tan@@ de@@ m 's chief executive officer 
 in the year-@@ earlier period tan@@ de@@ m reported net income of $ N million or N cents a share on revenue of $ N million 
 tan@@ de@@ m expects to report the full results for the quarter next week 
 analy@@ sts have predicted that the cu@@ per@@ tin@@ o cali@@ f@@ . company will report revenue of $ N million to $ N million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share 
 commenting on the results for the quarter m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said the strength of the company 's domestic business came as a surprise to him no@@ ting that sales in every region of the u@@ .s@@ . exceeded our plan 
 the company 's u@@ .s@@ . performance was helped by a record quarter for new customers he said 
 tan@@ de@@ m makes <@@ unk@@ > computers machines with <@@ unk@@ > backup systems that run stock exchanges networks of automatic <@@ unk@@ > and other complex computer systems 
 tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of main@@ frame computers 
 tan@@ de@@ m 's new high-@@ end computer is called <@@ unk@@ > 
 prices for the machine which can come in various <@@ unk@@ > are $ N million to $ N million 
 analy@@ sts expect the new computer to <@@ unk@@ > a he@@ fty <@@ unk@@ > of business away from i@@ b@@ m the long@@ time leader in main@@ frames 
 we believe they could <@@ unk@@ > perhaps two to three billion dollars from i@@ b@@ m over the next few years said ge@@ or@@ ge wei@@ ss an analy@@ st at the gar@@ t@@ ner group 
 that will sp@@ ur tan@@ de@@ m 's growth 
 i 'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than N N next year said jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > an analy@@ st at gold@@ man s@@ achs & co 
 i@@ b@@ m is expected to respond to tan@@ de@@ m 's <@@ unk@@ > by dis@@ counting its own main@@ frames which analy@@ sts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from tan@@ de@@ m 
 obviously i@@ b@@ m can give bigger discounts to users immediately said m@@ r@@ . wei@@ ss 
 but m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > questions whether that will be enough to stop tan@@ de@@ m 's first main@@ frame from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from big blue 's machines 
 the answer is n't price reduc@@ tions but new systems he said 
 nevertheless tan@@ de@@ m faces a variety of challenges the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as <@@ unk@@ > to i@@ b@@ m 's main@@ frames 
 even m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > is reluctant to abandon this notion insisting that tan@@ de@@ m 's new machines are n't <@@ unk@@ > for i@@ b@@ m 's main@@ frames 
 we 're after a little bigger nic@@ he he said 
 do n't jump yet 
 the stock market 's <@@ unk@@ > may turn out to be good news for the economy 
 in one wild hour of trading the market managed to accomplish what the bush administration has been trying to do un@@ successfully for weeks 
 it is forcing the federal reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously <@@ unk@@ > dollar 
 the resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could <@@ unk@@ > american business indeed the entire economy 
 this may sound <@@ unk@@ > optimistic 
 after all until a few years ago the stock market was viewed as a bar@@ ometer of the national economy 
 when it went down by all tradition the economy followed 
 that has changed partly because the two years following the worst stoc@@ k-@@ market plun@@ ge in history have been reasonably comfortable 
 the N crash was a false alarm however you view it says university of chic@@ ago economist vic@@ tor <@@ unk@@ > 
 the market seems increasingly <@@ unk@@ > from the rest of the nation 
 its <@@ unk@@ > ca n't be <@@ unk@@ > to fundamental business conditions nor do they appear to <@@ unk@@ > major shifts in the economy 
 the market today has a life of its own jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > chairman of international business machines cor@@ p. said saturday 
 there 's nothing rational about this kind of action 
 of course the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week 
 sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the u@@ .s@@ . now relies for financial <@@ unk@@ > 
 the financi@@ al-@@ services industry was batter@@ ed by the N crash 
 what 's more although the stock market is far less <@@ unk@@ > today than two years ago the u@@ .s@@ . economy is weaker 
 growth is slower 
 profits are softer 
 debt burdens are heavier 
 but if the stock market does n't continue to plu@@ m@@ met the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate 
 the fed which until friday had been <@@ unk@@ > moves to ease credit is now po@@ ised to pour money into the economy if needed to <@@ unk@@ > the markets 
 fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest@@ -@@ rate policies 
 but the experience of the N crash suggests the fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets 
 anticipating the fed 's move money tra@@ ders lowered a key interest rate known as the federal funds rate to N N late friday down from N N the day before 
 tiny movements in the rate which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans are usually among the few visible tracks that the fed leaves on the monetary markets 
 the dollar also began to decline friday as the stock market 's plun@@ ge caused some investors to <@@ unk@@ > their desire to invest in the u@@ .s@@ . 
 treas@@ ury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of <@@ unk@@ > with economic funda@@ mentals threatening to <@@ unk@@ > the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years 
 the market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the treas@@ ury was right about the <@@ unk@@ > dollar 
 a modest drop in the dollar only a modest one mind you would be welcomed by the u@@ .s@@ . 
 that was n't the case in N when the dollar was so weak that some econom@@ ists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse producing panic among foreign investors and <@@ unk@@ > the flow of foreign capital to the u@@ .s@@ . 
 another big difference between N and N is n't so <@@ unk@@ > 
 in the third quarter of N the economy <@@ unk@@ > at an infla@@ tion-@@ adjusted annual rate of N N 
 the consensus among econom@@ ists is that it grew a much more sluggish N N in the third quarter of N which ended two weeks ago 
 the plun@@ ge in stock prices is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down says economist la@@ wr@@ ence <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > group a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > pa@@ . fore@@ casting company 
 a lot of <@@ unk@@ > demand is gone 
 consumer spending did drop in the months following black monday N but only slightly and for a short period of time rec@@ alls m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > a long@@ time student of business cycles 
 that was offset by strength elsewhere 
 the effects were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected 
 today he <@@ unk@@ > exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers <@@ unk@@ > in reaction 
 what 's more the corporate borrowing bin@@ ge has n't <@@ unk@@ > in the past two years 
 we 've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt just at the time when earnings are being squeezed m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > notes 
 the more a company relies on borrowed money the greater its <@@ unk@@ > to an economic slow@@ down 
 a company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an un@@ anticipated storm a highly le@@ ver@@ aged company may end up in bankruptcy court 
 the fed of course knows that very well hence its <@@ unk@@ > to pump credit into the economy this morning 
 but in the process the fed risks <@@ unk@@ > inflation 
 even before friday 's events harv@@ ard university economist ben@@ jamin <@@ unk@@ > was arguing that the fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets banks and highly le@@ ver@@ aged corporations 
 the biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession he reasons it 's an <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > inflation 
 in the end the N collapse suggested the economy does n't move in <@@ unk@@ > with stock prices 
 the economy does however depend on the confidence of businesses consumers and foreign investors 
 a panic on wall street does n't exactly <@@ unk@@ > confidence 
 surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before friday 
 a 190@@ -@@ point drop is n't likely to make much of a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > that a few times over though and it will 
 if the reactions of executives gathered saturday at hot springs va@@ . for the business council meetings are typical business leaders were n't overly r@@ att@@ led by friday 's decline 
 and if foreign investors become a <@@ unk@@ > more cautious well the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the u@@ .s@@ . can stand it 
 on the bottom line the most <@@ unk@@ > fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before 
 two years ago about the only point of comparison was the N crash and the subsequent depression 
 the <@@ unk@@ > had a <@@ unk@@ > audience 
 the prosperity that followed black monday per@@ mits a more optimistic view today 
 at the very least the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last <@@ unk@@ > 
 as sen@@ . l@@ loy@@ d <@@ unk@@ > d. tex@@ as observed yesterday the fed avoided a <@@ unk@@ > last time 
 they are more sophisticated this time 
 the chemical industry is expected to report that profits ero@@ ded in the third quarter because of <@@ unk@@ > prices in the commodity end of the business 
 producers of commodity chemicals the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers 
 once the chief benef@@ ici@@ aries of the industry 's now <@@ unk@@ > boom these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the N third quarter 
 for some of these companies this will be the first quarter with year-@@ to-@@ year negative compar@@ isons says le@@ on@@ ard <@@ unk@@ > a chemical industry analy@@ st at pr@@ ud@@ ential <@@ unk@@ > research 
 this could be the first of five or six down quarters 
 perhaps most prominent d@@ ow chemical co@@ . which as of mid@@ year had rac@@ ked up eight consecutive record quarters is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier if only by a <@@ unk@@ > 
 though d@@ ow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceu@@ tic@@ als the company still has a big stake in poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e which is used in packaging and <@@ unk@@ > 
 analy@@ sts ' third-@@ quarter estimates for the mid@@ land mic@@ h@@ . company are between $ N a share and $ N a share compared with $ N a year ago when profit was $ N million on sales of $ N billion 
 a d@@ ow spo@@ kes@@ woman declined to comment on the estimates 
 at the investment firm of smith bar@@ ney har@@ ris up@@ ham & co@@ . the <@@ unk@@ > segment is seen pulling down overall profit for N companies representative of the whole industry by N N to N N 
 you will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better says ja@@ mes wil@@ b@@ ur a smith bar@@ ney analy@@ st 
 first bo@@ ston cor@@ p. projects that N of the N companies it follows will report lower profit 
 most of the N have big <@@ unk@@ > operations 
 still some industry gi@@ ants are expected to report continuing gains largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals 
 du p@@ ont co@@ . is thought to have had steady profit growth in white <@@ unk@@ > fi@@ bers and <@@ unk@@ > 
 moreover the wil@@ ming@@ ton del@@ . company is helped when prices weak@@ en on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs such as <@@ unk@@ > 
 analy@@ sts are divided over whether du p@@ ont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . oil company 
 the estimates for du p@@ ont range from $ N to $ N a share 
 in the N third quarter the company earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion 
 du p@@ ont declined to comment 
 mon@@ san@@ to co@@ . too is expected to continue reporting higher profit even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern eur@@ ope and the western u@@ .s@@ . 
 the st@@ . <@@ unk@@ > company is expected to report again that losses in its <@@ unk@@ > sear@@ le & co@@ . pharmaceutical business are narr@@ owing 
 sear@@ le continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year but mon@@ san@@ to has said it expects sear@@ le to post a profit for all of N 
 most estimates for mon@@ san@@ to run between $ N and $ N a share 
 a year ago the company posted third-@@ quarter profit of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion 
 mon@@ san@@ to declined to comment 
 but the <@@ unk@@ > producers are caught on the down@@ side of a pri@@ cing cycle 
 by some accounts on wall street and in the industry the inventory reduc@@ tions are near an end which may <@@ unk@@ > fir@@ mer demand 
 but <@@ unk@@ > say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early 1990s 
 in the latest quarter at least profit is expected to fall sharply 
 for <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . how far down it is we do n't know says le@@ sli@@ e <@@ unk@@ > at sal@@ om@@ on brothers 
 the projec@@ tions are in the neighborhood of N cents a share to N cents compared with a rest@@ ated $ N a share a year earlier when profit was $ N million on sales of $ N million 
 <@@ unk@@ > faces lower prices for its main@@ stay product <@@ unk@@ > while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bol@@ ster its raw material supply and develop new uses for <@@ unk@@ > whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries 
 the company based in wil@@ ming@@ ton del@@ . is <@@ unk@@ > by mon@@ te@@ di@@ son s.@@ p a@@ . mil@@ an which has an offer outstanding for the <@@ unk@@ > shares it does n't already own 
 at quantum chemical cor@@ p. new y@@ ork the trouble is lower prices for poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e higher debt costs and the <@@ unk@@ > of an important plant due to an explosion 
 some analy@@ sts he@@ dge their estimates for quantum because it is n't known when the company will book certain one-@@ time charges 
 but the estimates range from break@@ -@@ even to N cents a share 
 in the N third quarter quantum earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N million 
 another big poly@@ eth@@ y@@ len@@ e producer union car@@ bi@@ de cor@@ p. is expected to post profit of between $ N a share and $ N compared with $ N a share a year earlier when the company earned $ N million on sales of $ N billion

 there were no major <@@ unk@@ > or foreign bond offer@@ ings in eur@@ ope friday 
 the economy 's <@@ unk@@ > will be taken from several <@@ unk@@ > points this week with <@@ unk@@ > on trade output housing and inflation 
 the most troublesome report may be the au@@ gust merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow 
 the trade gap is expected to widen to about $ N billion from july 's $ N billion according to a survey by <@@ unk@@ > international a unit of mc@@ gra@@ w-@@ hill inc@@ . new y@@ ork 
 thursday 's report on the september consumer price index is expected to rise although not as sharply as the N N gain reported friday in the producer price index 
 that gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in friday 's session before it got started on its reckless 190@@ -@@ point plun@@ ge 
 econom@@ ists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in september reports on industrial production and capacity utilization also due tomorrow 
 meanwhile september housing starts due wednesday are thought to have in@@ ched upward 
 there 's a possibility of a surprise in the trade report said mic@@ ha@@ el <@@ unk@@ > director of research at <@@ unk@@ > 
 a wid@@ ening of the deficit if it were combined with a <@@ unk@@ > strong dollar would <@@ unk@@ > trade problems but the dollar weakened friday as stocks plu@@ mme@@ ted 
 in any event m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > and many others say that the easy gains in narr@@ owing the trade gap have already been made 
 trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow he said 
 exports are thought to have risen strongly in au@@ gust but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports econom@@ ists said 
 views on manufacturing strength are split between econom@@ ists who read september 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slow@@ down and those who use the somewhat more <@@ unk@@ > total employment figures in their calculations 
 the wide range of estimates for the industrial output number <@@ unk@@ > the differences the forecasts run from a drop of N N to an increase of N N according to <@@ unk@@ > 
 a re@@ bound in energy prices which helped push up the producer price index is expected to do the same in the consumer price report 
 the consensus view expects a N N increase in the september <@@ unk@@ > after a flat reading in au@@ gust 
 ro@@ bert h@@ . <@@ unk@@ > an economist for l@@ loy@@ d 's bank in new y@@ ork is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the <@@ unk@@ > than in prices at the producer level 
 auto prices had a big effect in the <@@ unk@@ > and at the <@@ unk@@ > level they wo n't he said 
 food prices are expected to be unchanged but energy costs jumped as much as N N said gary <@@ unk@@ > economist at <@@ unk@@ > financial group 
 he also says he thinks core inflation which <@@ unk@@ > the vo@@ la@@ tile food and energy prices was strong last month 
 he expects a gain of as much as N N in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases 
 housing starts are expected to <@@ unk@@ > a bit from au@@ gust 's annual pace of N units 
 econom@@ ists say an au@@ gust re@@ bound in per@@ mits for <@@ unk@@ > units sign@@ aled an increase in september starts though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards

 assuming the stock market does n't crash again and completely <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and trading rooms american television audiences in a few months may be seeing bri@@ tain 's concept of both 
 capital city is a weekly series that <@@ unk@@ > here three weeks ago amid unprecedented <@@ unk@@ > by its producer <@@ unk@@ > television 
 the early episodes make you long for a <@@ unk@@ > of the crash of N 
 let 's make that N just to be sure 
 according to the program 's publicity pro@@ spec@@ tus capital city set at <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > securi@@ ties firm with # N million capital follows the fortunes of a <@@ unk@@ > team of young <@@ unk@@ > dealers hired for their particular <@@ unk@@ > of style <@@ unk@@ > and energy 
 but with all the money and <@@ unk@@ > of high finance come the <@@ unk@@ > pressures to do well pressure to pull off another million before lunch pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second 
 you need n't be a <@@ unk@@ > securi@@ ties lawyer to realize the pro@@ spec@@ tus is guilty of less than full disclosure 
 the <@@ unk@@ > produced series has been criticized by london 's financial <@@ unk@@ > as inaccurate in detail but its major weakness is its <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > of the characters ' professional and private lives 
 turned loose in <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 's trading room the <@@ unk@@ > dealers do little right 
 judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 's capital should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week 
 in the opening episode we learn that <@@ unk@@ > a junior bond tra@@ der has indeed pulled off another million before lunch 
 trouble is she has lost it just as quickly 
 rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > about it to a <@@ unk@@ > man while ordering lunch over the phone 
 little chance that <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > is going to rec@@ oup today 
 tra@@ ders spend the morning <@@ unk@@ > selling bonds in the belief that the u@@ .s@@ . monthly trade figures will look <@@ unk@@ > 
 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > colu@@ mb@@ ia 
 the trade figures turn out well and all those recently <@@ unk@@ > bonds <@@ unk@@ > in price 
 so much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second 
 and a large <@@ unk@@ > of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly <@@ unk@@ > japanese bonds since when is anything japanese nearly <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 surprisingly <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > the week only to have a senior executive <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > his way into becoming the target of a criminal insi@@ der trading investigation 
 instead of closing ranks to protect the firm 's reputation the executive 's internal rivals led by a <@@ unk@@ > american demand his resignation 
 the plot is <@@ unk@@ > when the firm 's major <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > on the other side of the globe <@@ unk@@ > home to support the executive 
 but the investigation continues 
 if you can <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > that the rewards for such <@@ unk@@ > are <@@ unk@@ > salaries you still are left <@@ unk@@ > because few of the <@@ unk@@ > consume very <@@ unk@@ > 
 in fact few consume much of anything 
 two share a house almost <@@ unk@@ > of furniture 
 <@@ unk@@ > lives in a hotel room and although she drives a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > she has n't time to clean or repair it the <@@ unk@@ > vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of <@@ unk@@ > because the <@@ unk@@ > key has broken off in the lock 
 and it takes <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > ' man of the cast until the third episode to get past first base with any of his <@@ unk@@ > 
 perhaps the explanation for these <@@ unk@@ > is that <@@ unk@@ > bri@@ tain is n't ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > regime 
 after all this is n't old money but new money and in many cases young money 
 this attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of max the trading room 's most fla@@ m@@ boy@@ ant character 
 <@@ unk@@ > enough he lives in a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > converted church wears designer clothes and drives an <@@ unk@@ > car 
 but apparently to make him <@@ unk@@ > even <@@ unk@@ > to the <@@ unk@@ > the script <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > max into an <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > master of N chinese <@@ unk@@ > 
 he takes his wash to the <@@ unk@@ > where he meets a <@@ unk@@ > french girl who <@@ unk@@ > him into providing a home for her pet <@@ unk@@ > and then promptly <@@ unk@@ > his car and <@@ unk@@ > it in <@@ unk@@ > 
 in producing and promoting capital city <@@ unk@@ > has spent about as much as <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > loses on a good day 
 the production costs are a not <@@ unk@@ > # N million $ N million and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of dealers an earlier <@@ unk@@ > movie 
 another half million <@@ unk@@ > went for a <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > advertisements in six major british newspapers and for huge <@@ unk@@ > in the london subway 
 these expenses create a special incentive for capital city 's producers to <@@ unk@@ > it or a <@@ unk@@ > version of it in america 
 <@@ unk@@ > 's u@@ .s@@ . marketing agent donald <@@ unk@@ > is preparing to do just that 
 he is <@@ unk@@ > hopeful c@@ iting three u@@ .s@@ . comedy series three 's company too close for comfort and check it out that had british <@@ unk@@ > 
 perhaps without <@@ unk@@ > it m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution capital city should have been a comedy a worthy <@@ unk@@ > to the <@@ unk@@ > british carry on movies of the 1960s 
 the seeds already are in the script 
 the first episode concluded with a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > scene in which the <@@ unk@@ > crew <@@ unk@@ > a baby the casu@@ alty of a broken marriage at the firm 
 and many in the young cast bear striking <@@ unk@@ > to american tv and movie <@@ unk@@ > known for light roles 
 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > looks like a young <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > wi@@ lli@@ am arm@@ strong who plays max could pass for <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and dou@@ gla@@ s <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > for ja@@ mes <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > is a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > could easily double for <@@ unk@@ > hall the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > of the <@@ unk@@ > boys <@@ unk@@ > 
 so ok kids everybody on stage for carry on trading the cast is <@@ unk@@ > searching the office for <@@ unk@@ > japanese bonds that suddenly have so@@ ared in value because da@@ i-@@ ichi k@@ ang@@ yo bank has just bought the white house

 <@@ unk@@ > as@@ sur@@ ances of fr@@ ance gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ N billion acquisition of farmers group inc@@ . in am@@ ended fil@@ ings with insurance regul@@ ators in the nine u@@ .s@@ . states where farmers operates 
 the proposed acquisition is part of sir ja@@ mes gold@@ smith 's unfriendly take@@ over attempt for b@@ .@@ a.@@ t industries pl@@ c the british tobacco reta@@ iling paper and financial services concern that is parent of los ang@@ ele@@ s-@@ based farmers 
 in an attempt to <@@ unk@@ > u@@ .s@@ . regul@@ ators ' concern over a gold@@ smith acquisition of farmers sir ja@@ mes in au@@ gust agreed to sell farmers to ax@@ a if he is successful in acquiring b@@ .@@ a.@@ t 
 as part of the agreement ax@@ a agreed to invest $ N billion in <@@ unk@@ > investments l@@ t@@ d. sir ja@@ mes 's acquisition vehicle 
 of the total $ N billion to be paid to <@@ unk@@ > by ax@@ a about $ N billion will come from available resources of ax@@ a 's parent <@@ unk@@ > group $ N billion will be in the form of notes issued by ax@@ a and the remaining $ N billion will be in long-term bank loans 
 in an interview thursday <@@ unk@@ > be@@ bear chairman and chief executive officer of ax@@ a said his group has already obtained as@@ sur@@ ances from a group of banks led by ci@@ e financi@@ ere de par@@ i@@ b@@ as that they can provide the loan portion of the financing 
 the other banking companies in the group are credit ly@@ onna@@ is soci@@ e@@ te gener@@ ale bank@@ america cor@@ p. and ci@@ tic@@ or@@ p he said 
 m@@ r@@ . be@@ bear said <@@ unk@@ > group has more than $ N billion of <@@ unk@@ > assets that we can and will sell to help pay off debt from the acquisition 
 he said the assets to be sold would be <@@ unk@@ > assets including a beer company and a real estate firm and would n't include any pieces of farmers 
 we wo n't put any burden on farmers he said 
 the am@@ ended fil@@ ings also point out that under a new agreement <@@ unk@@ > has an <@@ unk@@ > obligation to sell farmers to ax@@ a upon an acquisition of b@@ .@@ a.@@ t 
 we hope that with what we did the regul@@ ators will not need to evaluate <@@ unk@@ > and they can directly look at the agreement with us because <@@ unk@@ > wo n't be an owner of farmers at anytime m@@ r@@ . be@@ bear said 
 any change of control in farmers needs approval of the insurance commission@@ ers in the nine states where farmers and its related companies are incorporated 
 the am@@ ended fil@@ ings were required because of the new agreement between ax@@ a and <@@ unk@@ > and to reflect the extension that sir ja@@ mes received last month under british take@@ over rules to complete his proposed acquisition 
 <@@ unk@@ > dropped its initial # N billion $ N billion take@@ over bid after it received the extension but said it would launch a new bid if and when the <@@ unk@@ > sale of farmers to ax@@ a receives regul@@ atory approval 
 a spo@@ kes@@ man for b@@ .@@ a.@@ t said of the am@@ ended fil@@ ings that it would appear that nothing <@@ unk@@ > has changed 
 the new financing structure is still a <@@ unk@@ > le@@ ver@@ aged one and ax@@ a still plans to take out N N of farmers ' earnings as divi@@ d@@ ends to service their debt 
 that divi@@ d@@ end is almost double the N N currently taken out of farmers by b@@ .@@ a.@@ t the spo@@ kes@@ man added 
 it would have severe implications for farmers ' policy holders 
 to f@@ end off sir ja@@ mes 's advances b@@ .@@ a.@@ t has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would <@@ unk@@ > it to a tobacco and financial services concern 
 dis@@ mal sales at general motors cor@@ p. dragged the u@@ .s@@ . car and truck market down below year-@@ ago levels in early oc@@ to@@ ber the first sales period of the N model year 
 the eight major domestic auto makers sold N north <@@ unk@@ > cars in the first N days of oc@@ to@@ ber a N N drop from a year earlier 
 domes@@ tically built truck sales were down N N to N <@@ unk@@ > v@@ ans and sport utility vehicles 
 the heavy use of incentives to clear out N models appears to have taken the steam at least initially out of N model sales which began officially oc@@ t. N 
 this appears particularly true at g@@ m which had strong sales in au@@ gust and september but saw its early oc@@ to@@ ber car and truck results fall N N from last year 's unusually high level 
 overall sales of all <@@ unk@@ > vehicles fell N N from a year ago 
 without g@@ m overall sales for the other u@@ .s@@ . <@@ unk@@ > were roughly flat with N results 
 some of the u@@ .s@@ . auto makers have already adopted incentives on many N models but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up 
 we 've created a condition where without incentives it 's a tough market said tom k@@ elly sales manager for bill <@@ unk@@ > ch@@ ev@@ ro@@ let in dear@@ born m@@ ich 
 car sales fell to a season@@ ally adjusted annual selling rate of N million vehicles the lowest since oc@@ to@@ ber N 
 the poor performance contra@@ sts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month 
 furthermore dealers contacted late last week said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of friday 's steep market decline 
 g@@ m 's domestic car sales dropped N N and its domestic trucks were down an even <@@ unk@@ > N N from the same period a year ago

 lex@@ us sales were n't available the cars are imported and to@@ yo@@ ta reports their sales only at <@@ unk@@ > 
 the sales drop for the no@@ . N car maker may have been caused in part by the end in september of dealer incentives that g@@ m offered in addition to consumer re@@ b@@ ates and <@@ unk@@ > financing a company spo@@ kes@@ man said 
 last year g@@ m had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the N models had been sold 
 aside from g@@ m other car makers posted generally mixed results 
 ford motor co@@ . had a N N drop in domestic car sales but a N N increase in domestic truck sales

 i think this is a victory for the radio says <@@ unk@@ > de <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > former <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > who works in the <@@ unk@@ > west ger@@ many headquarters as de@@ pu@@ ty director of the <@@ unk@@ > service 
 in fact the network hopes to set up offices in war@@ saw and anywhere else in the east blo@@ c that will have it 
 but the rapid changes brought on by glas@@ no@@ st and open borders are <@@ unk@@ > the network 's life in more ways than one 
 in fact radio free eur@@ ope is in danger of suffering from its success 
 while the network currently can operate freely in <@@ unk@@ > so can others 
 in addition competition for <@@ unk@@ > is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled 
 instead of being den@@ ounced as an evil agent of <@@ unk@@ > radio free eur@@ ope is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too <@@ unk@@ > even boring 
 they have a lot to do these days to compete with <@@ unk@@ > radio says and@@ re@@ w <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > student at the technical university in <@@ unk@@ > 
 the <@@ unk@@ > radio reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here 
 indeed hun@@ gary is in the midst of a media explosion 
 boys on busy street corners <@@ unk@@ > newspapers of every political <@@ unk@@ > 
 <@@ unk@@ > are packed with a <@@ unk@@ > arr@@ ay of magazines 
 radio and television are getting <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > 
 the british broadcasting cor@@ p. and the u@@ .s@@ . state department 's voice of america broadcast over <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > though only a few hours a day each in <@@ unk@@ > 
 austra@@ lian press <@@ unk@@ > ru@@ pert mur@@ do@@ ch has bought N N stakes in two popular and <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > newspapers while bri@@ tain 's ro@@ bert ma@@ x@@ well has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves 
 but radio free eur@@ ope does n't plan to <@@ unk@@ > away 
 with its mission for free speech and the capitali@@ st way the network 's staff says it still has plenty to do in hun@@ gary and in the great eastern beyond 
 radio free eur@@ ope and its sister station for the so@@ viet union radio liberty say they wo n't cut back their more than N hours of daily <@@ unk@@ > 
 they are still an important source of news for N million <@@ unk@@ > in N exotic <@@ unk@@ > from <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > to <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > 
 the establishment of its first burea@@ u in war@@ saw p@@ act territory shows the <@@ unk@@ > of some of the changes in eastern eur@@ ope 
 months before the decision by the <@@ unk@@ > communi@@ st party to <@@ unk@@ > itself soci@@ alist and try to look more appealing to voters the country 's <@@ unk@@ > were trying to look more <@@ unk@@ > 
 it proved a perfect time for radio free eur@@ ope to ask for permission to set up office 
 not only did the <@@ unk@@ > ministry of foreign affairs approve radio free eur@@ ope 's new location but the ministry of tele@@ communications did something even more amazing they found us four phone lines in central <@@ unk@@ > says <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > a radio free eur@@ ope <@@ unk@@ > who helped <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > location 
 that is a <@@ unk@@ > 
 it 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network which had to overcome <@@ unk@@ > of its <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > of local <@@ unk@@ > who filed reports to the network by phone secret <@@ unk@@ > or letters 
 in fact some of the network 's <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > say they owe radio free eur@@ ope loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the dark ages of the 20th century 
 during the past four years many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our <@@ unk@@ > says the writer 
 there were some very <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 the <@@ unk@@ > too had to be <@@ unk@@ > 
 through much of the <@@ unk@@ > war ii period listening to western <@@ unk@@ > was a crime in hun@@ gary 
 when we listen to the eur@@ ope station my mother still gets nervous says a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 she wants to turn down the volume and close the <@@ unk@@ > 
 now the <@@ unk@@ > competition for radio free eur@@ ope comes during the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 <@@ unk@@ > radio often <@@ unk@@ > its most politically out@@ spoken <@@ unk@@ > for around midnight 
 television which most of the time is considered rather <@@ unk@@ > has entered the running with a new program the end of the day which comes on after N p.m 
 it is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss hun@@ gary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs 
 those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on sunday morning for sunday journal on <@@ unk@@ > radio 
 the competitive spirit is clearly <@@ unk@@ > radio free eur@@ ope which is trying to beef up programs 
 the <@@ unk@@ > office plans to hire free-@@ l@@ ance reporters to cover the latest <@@ unk@@ > in <@@ unk@@ > country towns from <@@ unk@@ > in the west to <@@ unk@@ > in the east 
 the <@@ unk@@ > service has a daily <@@ unk@@ > news show called <@@ unk@@ > with international and domestic news plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world 
 there 's also a host of new programs trying to <@@ unk@@ > up on the traditional diet of politics 
 a daily <@@ unk@@ > program called the march of time tries to find interesting <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > news and <@@ unk@@ > from around the world 
 there 's a program for women and a science show 
 and to attract younger <@@ unk@@ > radio free eur@@ ope <@@ unk@@ > the latest in western rock groups 
 the pet shop boys are big this year in <@@ unk@@ > 
 we are <@@ unk@@ > for all the news says m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > the student 
 every moment we want to know everything about the world 
 proposals for <@@ unk@@ > national service like <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > up from time to time depre@@ ss the resistance of the body <@@ unk@@ > run their course and seem to disappear only to <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > public life <@@ unk@@ > 
 the disease <@@ unk@@ > comes to mind of course not as an <@@ unk@@ > on the advoc@@ ates of national service 
 rather it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing <@@ unk@@ > of a <@@ unk@@ > idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s along with <@@ unk@@ > 
 it is back with us again in the form of legislation to pay <@@ unk@@ > under a national and community service act a proposal with a serious shot at con@@ gre@@ ssional passage this fall 
 why does the <@@ unk@@ > virus keep coming back 
 perhaps it is because <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > both military experience and the social <@@ unk@@ > 
 if only we could get america 's <@@ unk@@ > youth into at least a <@@ unk@@ > uniform we might be able to teach <@@ unk@@ > again and revive the spirit of giving 
 a quarter of a century ago national service was <@@ unk@@ > as a way of <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > of the draft by of all things expanding the draft 
 those of us who resi@@ sted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many <@@ unk@@ > bac@@ kers despite their protests that present plans contain no <@@ unk@@ > 
 choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to <@@ unk@@ > national service as much as the draft 
 but the virus was kept alive in <@@ unk@@ > departments until a couple of years ago when it again was let loose 
 this time it attempted to <@@ unk@@ > two connected problems the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans 
 why not keep and even expand the loans and grants the advoc@@ ates <@@ unk@@ > but require some form of service from each <@@ unk@@ > 
 military service moreover could be a <@@ unk@@ > option 
 thus undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > conserv@@ atives <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > liber@@ als 
 the democratic leadership council a <@@ unk@@ > group <@@ unk@@ > the plan surely thought it might help the party to attract support especially among college students and their parents 
 a provision allowing grants to be applied to <@@ unk@@ > purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of <@@ unk@@ > 
 the <@@ unk@@ > plan <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > trees <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > children and <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > for $ N a week tax free plus medical care 
 with a tax@@ -free $ N <@@ unk@@ > payment at the end of each year the <@@ unk@@ > would be making a wage comparable to $ N a year 
 mind you most of the <@@ unk@@ > would be <@@ unk@@ > N to <@@ unk@@ > some not even high school graduates and many saving money by living at home 
 they would be doing better financially under national service than many tax@@ payers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families 
 as it happened political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system so the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of give in order to get 
 opposition to national service from the p@@ ent@@ agon which wants to protect its own <@@ unk@@ > process also led to the <@@ unk@@ > option being dropped 
 clearly a new ration@@ ale for national service had to be <@@ unk@@ > up 
 what better place to turn than sen@@ . ed@@ ward ken@@ ne@@ dy 's labor committee that great <@@ unk@@ > of government <@@ unk@@ > where many a <@@ unk@@ > pot of <@@ unk@@ > is kept on the back <@@ unk@@ > until it can be brought forward and presented as <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 before the <@@ unk@@ > is printed the house may add more <@@ unk@@ > also changing the initial price now posted at some $ N million 
 it is widely known that too many <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the <@@ unk@@ > especially if they are sen@@ ators 
 the om@@ ni@@ bus bill coming out of congress may be <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > but the <@@ unk@@ > chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the <@@ unk@@ > very hard 
 the <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > is in the air 
 is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such un@@ so@@ lic@@ ited assistance 
 on the contrary it is as robust as ever 
 according to the <@@ unk@@ > poll american adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen N N adjusted for inflation 
 even if government does see various <@@ unk@@ > needs national service is not the way to meet them 
 if we want to support students we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more <@@ unk@@ > based on something called <@@ unk@@ > rather than on the government 's idea of service 
 or we might provide a tax credit for working students 
 what we do not need to do is start a war and then try to justify it by creating a <@@ unk@@ > bill 
 to the extent we lack manpower to staff <@@ unk@@ > jobs in hospitals for example we should raise pay pursue <@@ unk@@ > technology or allow more legal <@@ unk@@ > rather than <@@ unk@@ > high school graduates as short-term workers and cause <@@ unk@@ > among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs 
 will national service in the current highly <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > form <@@ unk@@ > enough appeal to get adopted 
 not necessarily 
 po@@ lls show wide <@@ unk@@ > support for some vague concept of service but the bill now under discussion lacks any <@@ unk@@ > public backing 
 nonetheless sen@@ ate demo@@ crats are organizing a roll of supporting associations <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > some of which may hope to receive the paid <@@ unk@@ > 
 so far the president seems <@@ unk@@ > to substitute any of the om@@ ni@@ bus for his own <@@ unk@@ > proposal to <@@ unk@@ > a points of light foundation with $ N million to inform citizens of all ages and <@@ unk@@ > them to genuine <@@ unk@@ > 
 however even this <@@ unk@@ > plan could become <@@ unk@@ > if the white house gives in to con@@ gre@@ ssional democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in <@@ unk@@ > federal funds for volunteer projects 
 there 's no need for such con@@ ces@@ sions 
 the om@@ ni@@ bus can be defeated the virus controlled and real service protected 
 national service the <@@ unk@@ > idea still wo n't go away then of course but the millions of <@@ unk@@ > youth performing works of ci@@ vic content will be <@@ unk@@ > only in the <@@ unk@@ > of their <@@ unk@@ >

 president bush has out@@ lined his own youth entering service yes plan though its details remain to be specified 
 what is one to think of all this 
 doctr@@ ine and special interests govern some responses 
 people eager to have youth pay their <@@ unk@@ > to society favor service proposals <@@ unk@@ > mandatory ones 
 so do those who seek a <@@ unk@@ > concept of <@@ unk@@ > a concept imposing stern obligations as well as <@@ unk@@ > rights 
 then there are <@@ unk@@ > opponents 
 to <@@ unk@@ > mandatory service is an <@@ unk@@ > and voluntary systems are <@@ unk@@ > uses of tax money 
 <@@ unk@@ > of the market question the value of the work national service would perform 
 if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost 
 elements of the left are also <@@ unk@@ > opposed they see service as a cover for the draft or fear the <@@ unk@@ > of youth or want to see rights <@@ unk@@ > not obligations 
 but what about those of us whose views are not <@@ unk@@ > by formula or <@@ unk@@ > 
 how should we think about national service 
 let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service has no agreed meaning 
 would service be voluntary or <@@ unk@@ > 
 short or long 
 <@@ unk@@ > or full-time 
 paid or un@@ paid 
 would participants live at home and work nearby or live in <@@ unk@@ > and work on public <@@ unk@@ > 
 what kinds of work would they do 
 what does national mean 
 would the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations 
 and who would serve 
 only males as with the draft or both <@@ unk@@ > 
 youth only or all ages 
 middle-@@ class people or poor people or a genuine <@@ unk@@ > 
 many or few 
 those are not <@@ unk@@ > questions and the label national service answers none of them 
 then how should we think about national service 
 as a starting point here are five <@@ unk@@ > N consider the <@@ unk@@ > not the name 
 ignore national service in the <@@ unk@@ > consider specific proposals 
 they will differ in crucial ways 
 N service should be service 
 as commonly understood service implies sacrifice 
 it involves accepting risk or giving up income or de@@ fer@@ ring a career 
 it follows that proposals like <@@ unk@@ > whose benefits to <@@ unk@@ > are worth some $ N a year do not qualify 
 there is a ration@@ ale for such bills federal subsidies to college students amount to a <@@ unk@@ > bill without the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > those benefits should be earned not given 
 but the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs 
 why call that service 
 N encouragement is fine <@@ unk@@ > is not 
 <@@ unk@@ > service is un@@ constitu@@ tional 
 it is also <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > 
 who will throw several hundred thousand <@@ unk@@ > in jail each year 
 but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior 
 it should also encourage service <@@ unk@@ > by all classes and all ages 
 its encouragement should strengthen and not under@@ cut the strong tradition of <@@ unk@@ > in the u@@ .s@@ . should build on the service programs already in existence and should honor local convic@@ tions about which tasks most need doing 
 N good programs are not cheap 
 enthusi@@ asts assume that national service would get important work done <@@ unk@@ > forest fires fought housing <@@ unk@@ > students <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > centers <@@ unk@@ > 
 there is important work to be done and existing service and conservation cor@@ ps have shown that even <@@ unk@@ > who start with few skills can do much of it well but not <@@ unk@@ > 
 good service programs require <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > training and supervision all of high quality 
 they involve <@@ unk@@ > to participants 
 full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year at stan@@ ford or y@@ ale 
 <@@ unk@@ > programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ N a year 
 are they worth that 
 <@@ unk@@ > suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted 
 but the calculations are <@@ unk@@ > 
 N <@@ unk@@ > youth are a special concern 
 are such expenditures <@@ unk@@ > then 
 yes if targeted 
 people of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there are many ways for middle-@@ class kids and their elders to serve at little public cost 
 they can volunteer at any of thousands of <@@ unk@@ > institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers 
 <@@ unk@@ > youth do n't have those opportunities 
 they are not <@@ unk@@ > in high school or college 
 they are unlikely to be employed 
 and they have grown up in <@@ unk@@ > gri@@ m circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and b@@ leak prospects 
 but many of them can be quite <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > by productive and disciplined service 
 some wo n't accept the discipline others drop out for other reasons 
 but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed 
 learning skills producing something <@@ unk@@ > feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them 
 even if it is cheaper to build <@@ unk@@ > or <@@ unk@@ > apartments or plant <@@ unk@@ > with paid professionals the effects on the young people providing those services alter the <@@ unk@@ > 
 strictly speaking these youth are not performing service 
 they are giving up no income de@@ fer@@ ring no careers <@@ unk@@ > no risk 
 but they believe themselves to be serving and they begin to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives to think of the future 
 that is a service to the nation 
 it is what federal support should try hardest to achieve

 lex@@ ington books N 
 government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a monday market <@@ unk@@ > but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet 
 federal reserve chairman al@@ an green@@ span was on the telephones making it clear to officials in the u@@ .s@@ . and abroad that the fed was prepared to <@@ unk@@ > massive amounts of money into the banking system as it did in oc@@ to@@ ber N if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis 
 and at the treas@@ ury secretary nic@@ ho@@ las bra@@ dy talked with friends and associates on wall street while assistant secretary da@@ vid mul@@ l@@ ins carefully <@@ unk@@ > data on the friday market plun@@ ge 
 but the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jit@@ ters 
 in addition officials at the fed and in the bush administration decided that avoiding <@@ unk@@ > actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's r@@ out 
 the disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis said one government official insisting on <@@ unk@@ > 
 the fed 's efforts at <@@ unk@@ > were partly <@@ unk@@ > sunday morning when both the new y@@ ork times and the wash@@ ington post carried stories <@@ unk@@ > a senior fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system monday morning 
 fed chairman green@@ span was surprised by both stories according to knowledgeable sources and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment 
 nevertheless fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate <@@ unk@@ > of the central bank 's game plan 
 it is prepared to assume the same role it played in oc@@ to@@ ber N providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system af@@ lo@@ at 
 the fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securi@@ ties from financial institutions 
 the <@@ unk@@ > of federal officials was evident in the appearance sunday of budget director rich@@ ard dar@@ man on ab@@ c 's this week 
 secretary of the treas@@ ury bra@@ dy and chairman green@@ span and the chairman of the sec and others have been in close contact 
 i 'm sure they 'll do what 's right what 's pr@@ udent what 's <@@ unk@@ > he said 
 when it was suggested his comment was a <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . dar@@ man replied it is a <@@ unk@@ > 
 but in this context that 's the smart thing to do 
 at the treas@@ ury secretary bra@@ dy issued a statement <@@ unk@@ > the stock market 's drop 
 today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy he said 
 the economy remains <@@ unk@@ > and the outlook is for continued moderate growth 
 but administration officials conce@@ ded that friday 's drop carried the chance of further decl@@ ines this week 
 one possibility is that this is a surgical set@@ back reasonably limited in its <@@ unk@@ > and not a major problem said one senior administration official who also asked that he not be named 
 the other is that we see another major disaster like two years ago 
 i think that 's less likely 
 nevertheless fed chairman green@@ span and vice chairman manu@@ el jo@@ hn@@ son were in their offices sunday evening monitoring events as they <@@ unk@@ > in markets around the world 
 the action was expected to begin with the opening of the new zealand foreign exchange markets at N p.m. est when stocks there plun@@ ged and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in tokyo and through early this morning in eur@@ ope 
 both the treas@@ ury and the fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments 
 in tokyo share prices dropped sharply by N N in early monday morning trading 
 after the initial slide the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower 
 in the bush administration the lead is being taken by treas@@ ury secretary bra@@ dy under@@ secretary ro@@ bert <@@ unk@@ > and assistant secretary mul@@ l@@ ins 
 the three men worked together on the so-called bra@@ dy commission headed by m@@ r@@ . bra@@ dy which was established after the N crash to examine the market 's collapse 
 as a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets and financial market crises 
 m@@ r@@ . bra@@ dy was at the white house friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began 
 he was quickly on the phone with m@@ r@@ . mul@@ l@@ ins who in turn was talking with the chair@@ men of the new y@@ ork and chic@@ ago exchanges 
 later m@@ r@@ . bra@@ dy <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . green@@ span sec chairman rich@@ ard bree@@ den and numerous contacts in new y@@ ork and overseas 
 ai@@ des say he continued to work the phones through the weekend 
 administration officials say president bush was <@@ unk@@ > throughout friday afternoon and evening even after leaving for camp da@@ vid 
 he had frequent telephone <@@ unk@@ > with m@@ r@@ . bra@@ dy and mic@@ ha@@ el <@@ unk@@ > chairman of the coun@@ sel of economic advi@@ sers 
 government officials tried throughout the weekend to <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic 
 treas@@ ury under@@ secretary da@@ vid mul@@ ford for instance was at a meeting of the business council in hot springs va@@ . when the stock market fell and remained there through the following day 
 and as of last night fed chairman green@@ span had n't canceled his plans to address the american ban@@ kers association convention in wash@@ ington at N a.m. this morning 
 ironically m@@ r@@ . green@@ span was scheduled to address the same convention in dal@@ las on oc@@ t. N N 
 he flew to dal@@ las on oc@@ t. N when the market plu@@ mme@@ ted N points but then turned around the next morning and returned to wash@@ ington without delivering his speech

 resist the urge to call your bro@@ ker and sell all your stocks 
 that 's the advice of most investment professionals after friday 's 190@@ -@@ point drop in the d@@ ow j@@ ones industrial average 
 no one can say for sure what will happen today 
 and investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months 
 but they 're nearly <@@ unk@@ > on one point do n't sell into a panic 
 investors who sold everything after the crash of N lived to regret it 
 even after friday 's plun@@ ge the d@@ ow j@@ ones industrial average was N N above where it landed on oc@@ t. N two years ago 
 panic selling also was <@@ unk@@ > during other big decl@@ ines in the past 
 the crash of N was followed by a substantial recovery before the great depression and awful bear market of the 19@@ 30s began 
 the oc@@ to@@ ber <@@ unk@@ > of N and N were scary but did n't lead to severe or sustained <@@ unk@@ > 
 indeed some pros see friday 's plun@@ ge plus any further damage that might occur early this week as a chance for bargain hunting 
 there has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash says step@@ hen b@@ . <@@ unk@@ > chief investment officer of chic@@ ag@@ o-@@ based ke@@ mper financial services in@@ c 
 but most advi@@ sers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand p@@ at 
 when you see a run@@ away train says ste@@ ve <@@ unk@@ > partner in the san fr@@ anci@@ sco investment advi@@ sory firm br@@ ou@@ wer & <@@ unk@@ > you wait for the train to stop 
 even for people who expect a bear market in coming months and a si@@ zable number of money managers and market <@@ unk@@ > do the advice is wait for the market to bounce back and sell shares gradually during r@@ al@@ lies 
 the best thing individual investors can do is just sit tight says mar@@ shall b@@ . front executive vice president and head of investment counseling at stein roe & <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . a chic@@ ag@@ o-@@ based investment counseling firm that manages about $ N billion 
 on the one hand m@@ r@@ . front says it would be <@@ unk@@ > to sell into a classic panic 
 on the other hand it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy 
 this is all <@@ unk@@ > right now and when <@@ unk@@ > starts to run it can run further than anyone anticip@@ ates he said 
 so it 's more pr@@ udent to wait and see how things stabi@@ lize 
 ro@@ ger <@@ unk@@ > professor of finance at y@@ ale university and head of the market information firm <@@ unk@@ > associates inc@@ . says my real advice would be to just ride through it 
 generally it is n't <@@ unk@@ > to be in and out of the stock market 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > thinks that this week is going to be a roll@@ er-@@ coaster week 
 but he also thinks it is a good week to consider buying 
 jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > former president of the los angel@@ es chapter of the national association of investors cor@@ p. an organization of investment clubs and individual investors says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of N and see no reason to sell now

 and we hope to take advantage of <@@ unk@@ > and buy stocks when they plun@@ ge 
 one camp of investment pros sees what happened friday as an opportunity 
 over the next days and weeks they say investors should look for stocks to buy 
 friday 's action was an old-fashioned panic says al@@ fr@@ ed gold@@ man director of technical market analysis for a.@@ g. ed@@ wards & sons in st@@ . lou@@ is 
 stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price 
 his advice you ought to be there with a basket catching them 
 ja@@ mes cra@@ ig portfolio manager for the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > fund which has one of the industry 's better track records started his buying during friday 's plun@@ ge 
 stocks such as <@@ unk@@ > foods cor@@ p. <@@ unk@@ > stores inc@@ . american international group inc@@ . and federal national mort@@ gage association became such bar@@ gains that he could n't resist them he says 
 and m@@ r@@ . cra@@ ig expects to pick up more shares today 
 it will be chaotic at first but i would not be buying if i thought we were headed for real trouble he says 
 he argues that stocks are reasonably valued now and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of N 
 m@@ r@@ . front of stein roe suggests that any buying should concentrate in stocks that have lag@@ ged the market on the up side or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction 
 his firm favors selected computer drug and <@@ unk@@ > stocks 
 other investment pros are more pessimistic 
 they say investors should sell stocks but not necessarily right away 
 many of them stress that the selling can be orderly gradual and done when stock prices are <@@ unk@@ > 
 on thursday wi@@ lli@@ am <@@ unk@@ > a se@@ attle money manager used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market aver@@ ages would decline 
 he thinks the under@@ lying inflation rate is around N N to N N far higher than most people <@@ unk@@ > 
 in the pension accounts he manages m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks partly as an inflation he@@ dge 
 he thinks government officials are <@@ unk@@ > to let a recession start when government corporate and personal debt levels are so high 
 so he thinks the government will <@@ unk@@ > on the side of <@@ unk@@ > inflation 
 as a result m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says i think the ball game 's over and investors are about to face a bear market 
 da@@ vid m. j@@ ones vice president at <@@ unk@@ > g. <@@ unk@@ > & co@@ . recommends treas@@ ury securi@@ ties of up to five years ' maturity 
 he says the oc@@ t. N employment report showing slower economic growth and a severe weak@@ ening in the manufacturing sector is a warning sign to investors 
 one strategy for investors who want to stay in but he@@ dge their be@@ ts is to buy put options either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index 
 a put option gives its holder the right but not the obligation to sell a stock or stock index for a specified price the strike price until the option expi@@ res 
 whether this insurance is <@@ unk@@ > depends on the cost of an option 
 the cost or premium tends to get fat in times of crisis 
 thus buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to he@@ dge against risk 
 the prices of puts generally did n't so@@ ar friday 
 for example the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on e@@ li li@@ lly & co@@ . moved up from N N at thursday 's close to only N N at friday 's close even though the shares dropped more than $ N 
 but <@@ unk@@ > prices may <@@ unk@@ > when trading <@@ unk@@ > today 
 it 's hard to <@@ unk@@ > about a reasonable price for puts 
 but investors should keep in mind before paying too much that the average annual return for stock hol@@ dings long-term is N N to N N a year a return of N N is considered <@@ unk@@ > 
 paying say N N for insurance against losses takes a deep <@@ unk@@ > out of the return

 <@@ unk@@ > banker commercial group said it sold $ N million of common stock to its employees at $ N a share giving them a total stake of more than N N in the commercial real estate bro@@ ker@@ age firm 
 the firm which was acquired in april from sear@@ s ro@@ e@@ buck & co@@ . in a manag@@ e@@ ment-@@ led bu@@ y-@@ out had planned to sell up to $ N million of stock or a N N stake in the company to its N employees 
 though the offering did n't sell out ja@@ mes j@@ . <@@ unk@@ > chairman and chief executive officer said we 're pretty proud of the employees ' response 
 he noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan where a company usually <@@ unk@@ > money from third party len@@ ders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time here employees had to <@@ unk@@ > out their own cash for the stock 
 they came up with their own money instead of borrowed money m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said 
 it 's totally different 
 he said the offering was designed to create long-term incentives for employees 
 we 're in a service business and in that context it 's vital to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success 
 the bro@@ ker@@ age firm wo n't pay a divi@@ d@@ end on the stock 
 employees have the right to trade stock among themselves and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions 
 they may also eventually sell the shares to third parties but the outside investors who own the remaining N N of <@@ unk@@ > banker have the right to first ref@@ usal

 the first major event this morning in u@@ .s@@ . stock and futures trading may be a <@@ unk@@ > at the chic@@ ago mer@@ can@@ tile exchange 
 under a reform arising from the N crash trading in the mer@@ c 's stoc@@ k-@@ index futures will break for N minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from friday 's close a move equal to N points on the d@@ ow j@@ ones industrial average 
 the aim of the <@@ unk@@ > would be to ease the opening of the new y@@ ork stock exchange which would be <@@ unk@@ > by such a vo@@ la@@ tile move on the mer@@ c 
 that <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > is just one of a number of <@@ unk@@ > adopted after the N crash 
 the big board also added computer capacity to handle huge <@@ unk@@ > in trading volume 
 several of those post-@@ crash changes kicked in during friday 's one-@@ hour collapse and worked as expected even though they did n't prevent a stunning plun@@ ge 
 but the major circuit brea@@ kers have yet to be <@@ unk@@ > 
 a deeper market plun@@ ge today could give them their first test 
 a further slide also would <@@ unk@@ > debate over a host of other more sweeping changes proposed but not implemented after the last crash 
 most not@@ ably several of the regul@@ atory steps recommended by the bra@@ dy task force which <@@ unk@@ > the N crash would be revived especially because that group 's chairman is now the treas@@ ury secretary 
 the most controversial of the bra@@ dy recommendations involved establishing a single <@@ unk@@ > regul@@ ator to handle crucial <@@ unk@@ > questions such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets 
 but for the moment attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place and market regul@@ ators and participants said the circuit brea@@ kers worked as intended 
 big board and mer@@ c officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the mer@@ c 's standard & poor 's N contract as well as <@@ unk@@ > communications among exchanges 
 those <@@ unk@@ > from N p.m. to N p.m. <@@ unk@@ > and from N p.m. until the close of trading a half-@@ hour later forced tra@@ ders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels 
 during the first halt after the s@@ &@@ p index had fallen N points the big board 's <@@ unk@@ > computer program automatically was triggered 
 that system is designed to separate <@@ unk@@ > program tra@@ des from all other tra@@ des to help exchange officials resolve order imbal@@ ances in individual stocks 
 one mer@@ c bro@@ ker compared the action in the s@@ &@@ p pit during the two <@@ unk@@ > to a fire at a <@@ unk@@ > school 
 you do n't want the fire but you know what to do said how@@ ard <@@ unk@@ > an independent floor bro@@ ker and a mer@@ c governor 
 there was no panic 
 the system worked the way we devi@@ sed it to work 
 after <@@ unk@@ > for about N minutes the s@@ &@@ p index tu@@ mbled to its <@@ unk@@ > limit and the second freeze went into effect 
 tra@@ ders then spent the last half-@@ hour watching to see if the d@@ ow would drop N points m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > added referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour 
 one <@@ unk@@ > estimated that N N to N N of the s@@ &@@ p tra@@ ders were just standing around watching 
 but the <@@ unk@@ > circuit breaker never had to kick in and <@@ unk@@ > on the chic@@ ago board of trade 's major market index also were n't triggered 
 the m@@ mi and the s@@ &@@ p N are the two major inde@@ xes used by program tra@@ ders to run their computer@@ ized trading strategies 
 the programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the N crash 
 the process of post-@@ crash reforms began with calls to <@@ unk@@ > the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjust@@ ments 
 in oc@@ to@@ ber N just after the market drop wash@@ ington was <@@ unk@@ > in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated 
 over the next year that grand agenda was <@@ unk@@ > down to a series of steps to sof@@ ten big stock drops by <@@ unk@@ > trading to give market players time to <@@ unk@@ > and reconsider positions 
 in addition limits were placed on computer-@@ driven trading and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets 
 few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated 
 at the out@@ set the prime target was program trading which was much discussed but little understood on cap@@ it@@ ol hill 
 there were also calls to strip the stock markets of deri@@ v@@ ative products such as stoc@@ k-@@ index futures and options which federal judge stan@@ ley <@@ unk@@ > for example <@@ unk@@ > to <@@ unk@@ > attached to the basic market 
 and there was much criticism of the new y@@ ork stock exchange 's system of having stock tra@@ des flow through specialists or market makers 
 when the bra@@ dy task force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in jan@@ uary N it immediately <@@ unk@@ > the re@@ formers ' agenda 
 arguing that the separate financial <@@ unk@@ > acted as one and conclud@@ ing that the crash had raised the possibility of a <@@ unk@@ > financial system breakdown the presidential task force called for establishing a <@@ unk@@ > to over@@ see the markets to make mar@@ gins consistent across markets to <@@ unk@@ > clearing systems and to install circuit brea@@ kers 
 only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented 
 the re@@ ag@@ an white house held the bra@@ dy recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel the working group on the financial markets to review its analysis and those of other crash studies 
 in may N the working group made up of representatives from the federal reserve the treas@@ ury the securi@@ ties and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission finally end@@ or@@ sed only circuit brea@@ kers 
 after several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets circuit brea@@ kers were set in place with the most notable <@@ unk@@ > trading after N and N point drops in the d@@ ow j@@ ones industrial average 
 privately some free <@@ unk@@ > dismissed such <@@ unk@@ > as <@@ unk@@ > to <@@ unk@@ > 
 after all this free-@@ market argument went the d@@ ow only dropped more than N points once this century 
 circuit brea@@ kers set to sof@@ ten big drops 
 if s@@ &@@ p futures fall N points at opening contract trading <@@ unk@@ > for N minutes 
 if d@@ ow industri@@ als fall N points at opening contract trading <@@ unk@@ > for N minutes

 it all seemed innocent enough last april one st@@ even b@@ . <@@ unk@@ > visited ju@@ stin products inc@@ . here identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company 's new <@@ unk@@ > players for children 
 it is almost identical to the son@@ y product m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > after seeing <@@ unk@@ > and pictures 
 replied a ju@@ stin salesman exactly 
 the ju@@ stin merchandise carried whole@@ sale prices some N N below those of son@@ y cor@@ p. of japan 's my first son@@ y line 
 the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > enthusiastic and promised to return 
 but instead of a new customer part of a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > from <@@ unk@@ > son@@ y ju@@ stin got a costly legal <@@ unk@@ > 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > it turned out was a private <@@ unk@@ > using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for son@@ y 
 his recording later turned up as a court exhibit 
 seeking to keep ju@@ stin 's my own product line off the u@@ .s@@ . market son@@ y last may filed a suit in man@@ hattan federal court <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > of trade@@ mark infr@@ in@@ gement unfair competition and other vio@@ lations of business law 
 since then life has changed a lot for <@@ unk@@ > le@@ on@@ ard <@@ unk@@ > ju@@ stin 's owner 
 i have n't been able to get a decent night 's sleep since this has been going on he says 
 it 's the most <@@ unk@@ > thing in my life i ca n't even attend to my business 
 his company annual sales about $ N million may suffer a costly blow losing an estimated N N of total sales if son@@ y annual sales about $ N billion <@@ unk@@ > 
 ju@@ stin 's p@@ light shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a <@@ unk@@ > multinational 
 with considerable irony the case also shows how completely japan has turned the tables on u@@ .s@@ . business 
 americ@@ ans used to complain bitterly about being <@@ unk@@ > by <@@ unk@@ > products from japan 
 now son@@ y whose innovative <@@ unk@@ > products are among the most <@@ unk@@ > in consumer electronics is bitterly complaining about a little u@@ .s@@ . firm with a cheap <@@ unk@@ > produced in china 
 the <@@ unk@@ > of this is that ju@@ stin knocked off the son@@ y line and son@@ y wants to stop it says le@@ w@@ is h@@ . <@@ unk@@ > son@@ y 's attorney who previously <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 's <@@ unk@@ > 
 son@@ y itself decl@@ ines to comment 
 if son@@ y wins m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas 
 at worst he adds they 'd have to <@@ unk@@ > them all up and throw them away 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > den@@ ies the suit 's charges and says his only mistake was taking on son@@ y in the market@@ place 
 i made a similar line and i produced it cheaper he says 
 today u@@ .s@@ . judge jo@@ hn e. <@@ unk@@ > is expected to rule on son@@ y 's renewed request for a pre-@@ trial order blo@@ cking sale of the dispu@@ ted products on which deliver@@ ies began in july 
 the judge turned down an earlier son@@ y request for such an order a decision up@@ held on appeal but son@@ y returned with additional evidence and arguments 
 though hoping to settle the case ju@@ stin <@@ unk@@ > to fight on if necessary 
 but the battle is more than ju@@ stin <@@ unk@@ > for 
 i had no idea i was getting in so deep says m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > who founded ju@@ stin in N 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > had sold <@@ unk@@ > inc@@ . a tai@@ wan electronics maker and retired only to find he was <@@ unk@@ > 
 with ju@@ stin he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in h@@ ong kong beginning with <@@ unk@@ > mouse <@@ unk@@ > 
 the company has grown to about N employees from four initially m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says 
 ju@@ stin has been profitable since N adds the official who shares his office with numerous teddy bears all samples from his line of <@@ unk@@ > toys 
 like many others m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > took notice in N when son@@ y in a classic example of market <@@ unk@@ > changed the plastic skin and <@@ unk@@ > on the famous <@@ unk@@ > line of portable audio equipment and created the my first son@@ y line for children 
 the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > new products looked more like toys than the adult models 
 in court papers son@@ y says it has spent more than $ N million to promote the line with resulting sales of over a million units 
 son@@ y found a new market nic@@ he but m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > figured that its prices left plenty of room for a <@@ unk@@ > competitor 
 his products are n't exact copies of son@@ y 's but strongly resemble them in size shape and especially color 
 son@@ y uses mostly red and blue with <@@ unk@@ > of yellow and so does ju@@ stin on the theory that kids prefer these colors 
 to be successful a product can be any color <@@ unk@@ > as long as it is <@@ unk@@ > red says char@@ les e. <@@ unk@@ > ju@@ stin 's attorney 
 by last winter ju@@ stin was showing <@@ unk@@ > at toy <@@ unk@@ > in h@@ ong kong and new y@@ ork and son@@ y noticed 
 indeed concerned that son@@ y sales personnel were threatening legal action or other <@@ unk@@ > such as <@@ unk@@ > desirable son@@ y products against ju@@ stin 's customers m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > fired off a letter to son@@ y in april 
 he himself threatened to take the matter to the federal trade commission or u@@ .s@@ . justice department 
 but ju@@ stin has n't pursued those charges which were without merit according to m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > the son@@ y attorney 
 rec@@ alls m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone 
 we never intended taking on son@@ y we do n't have the resources 
 son@@ y answered the empty threat with its real suit 
 off and on since then the companies have <@@ unk@@ > in court 
 and ju@@ stin in a news release says once competitive son@@ y now resorts to <@@ unk@@ > tactics in american <@@ unk@@ > to <@@ unk@@ > out and protect nic@@ he markets 
 son@@ y 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics including the use of a private <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > as a buyer are routine in such matters 
 he also insists that son@@ y no less than others has a legal right to protect its trade dress in this case mostly the colors that it claims make my first son@@ y products distinctive 
 ju@@ stin claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before son@@ y entered the children 's market 
 whatever its merits son@@ y 's aggressive defense is <@@ unk@@ > for ju@@ stin 
 it 's also costly 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says he has paid more than $ N in legal fees so far 
 of son@@ y m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says they know there 's no way for them to lose 
 they just keep <@@ unk@@ > me in deeper until i reach the point where i give up and go away

 the market for $ N billion of high-@@ risk junk bonds batter@@ ed by a succession of de@@ faults and huge price decl@@ ines this year practically <@@ unk@@ > friday 
 trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds only to find themselves <@@ unk@@ > by potential buyers 
 stunned they watched bro@@ ker@@ age houses mark down price quotations on their junk hol@@ dings while being able to execute very few actual tra@@ des 
 the junk bond market is in a state of gri@@ d@@ lock now there are no bi@@ ds only offers says independent invest@@ or mar@@ tin d. <@@ unk@@ > who manages nearly $ N billion and who recently decided to buy <@@ unk@@ > securi@@ ties for a new fund 
 this <@@ unk@@ > is far from over he says 
 junk 's collapse helped <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > selling of stocks that produced the <@@ unk@@ > one-day dive in the d@@ ow j@@ ones industrial average since the oc@@ t. N N crash 
 simultaneously it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the u@@ .s@@ . government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the <@@ unk@@ > securi@@ ties they could find 
 but an <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > the junk market friday as prices tu@@ mbled on hundreds of high-@@ yield bonds despite no active trading says jo@@ hn <@@ unk@@ > an economist at moody 's investors service in@@ c 
 for example the price of <@@ unk@@ > cor@@ p. 's $ N million of N N N bonds due N sold less than two years ago by gold@@ man s@@ achs & co@@ . plu@@ mme@@ ted N N to just N cents on the dollar 
 but not even gold@@ man would make a market in the securi@@ ties of <@@ unk@@ > the owner of the nationwide chain of N convenience stores that is str@@ apped for cash 
 gold@@ man officials declined to comment 
 junk bonds which <@@ unk@@ > from less than $ N billion at the start of this decade have been declining for months as issu@@ er after issu@@ er sank beneath the weight of he@@ fty interest payments 
 the sha@@ ky market received its biggest jo@@ lt last month from ca@@ m@@ pe@@ au cor@@ p. which created its u@@ .s@@ . reta@@ iling empire with junk financing 
 ca@@ m@@ pe@@ au developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be <@@ unk@@ > on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <@@ unk@@ > de@@ part@@ ment-@@ store chain up for sale 
 now dozens of corporations including <@@ unk@@ > all@@ en tw services and y@@ ork international that are counting on at least $ N billion of scheduled new junk fin@@ anc@@ ings to keep their highly le@@ ver@@ aged take@@ overs and bu@@ y-@@ outs af@@ lo@@ at may never get the money 
 the music has stopped playing says mic@@ ha@@ el <@@ unk@@ > a principal in the investment firm of le@@ vy <@@ unk@@ > 
 you 've either got a chair or you do n't 
 in friday 's aftermath says r@@ . dou@@ gla@@ s <@@ unk@@ > a director of high-@@ yield finance at first bo@@ ston cor@@ p. much of the $ N billion forward calendar could be de@@ fer@@ red depending on the <@@ unk@@ > 
 in au@@ gust first bo@@ ston withdrew a $ N million junk offering of o@@ hi@@ o <@@ unk@@ > bonds because potential buyers were very <@@ unk@@ > 
 the outlook looks sha@@ ky because we 're still waiting for mutual funds in particular to dump some of their junk bond hol@@ dings to pay off re@@ de@@ mptions by individual investors says king <@@ unk@@ > senior vice president at <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > & <@@ unk@@ > an investment arm of x@@ er@@ ox financial services 
 indeed a moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of N high-@@ yield mutual funds declined for the <@@ unk@@ > consecutive day friday 
 in a star@@ k contrast the ben@@ ch@@ mark 30@@ -year treas@@ ury bond climbed more than N N points or about $ N for each $ N face amount to N N its biggest gain of the year 
 the bond 's yield dropped to N N the lowest since march N N according to technical data global markets group 
 the yield on three-@@ month treas@@ ury bills considered the <@@ unk@@ > of all investments plu@@ mme@@ ted about N percentage point to N N the largest one-day decline since N 
 the main cat@@ aly@@ st for government bond market rally was the 19@@ 0.@@ 5@@ 8-@@ point drop in the d@@ ow j@@ ones industrial average 
 when you get panic in one market you get flight to quality in the other said mar@@ ia rami@@ re@@ z money market economist at dre@@ x@@ el burn@@ ham la@@ mb@@ ert in@@ c 
 nevertheless the problems of the junk market could prompt the federal reserve to ease credit in the months ahead 
 this marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook says wi@@ lli@@ am sul@@ li@@ van director of money market research at de@@ an wi@@ tter re@@ y@@ no@@ l@@ ds inc@@ . new y@@ ork 
 any sustained <@@ unk@@ > could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securi@@ ties 
 ro@@ bert d@@ ow a partner and portfolio manager at lord <@@ unk@@ > & co@@ . which manages $ N billion of high-@@ yield bonds says he does n't think there is any fundamental economic ration@@ ale for the junk bond r@@ out 
 it was <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 he adds the junk market has <@@ unk@@ > some trouble and now some people think that if the equ@@ ity market gets <@@ unk@@ > that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk 
 i do n't believe that 's the case but i believe that people are running scared 
 there is a flight to quality and the quality is not in equi@@ ties and not in junk it 's in treas@@ ur@@ ys 
 even as trading in high-@@ yield issues <@@ unk@@ > up over the past month corporations sold more than $ N billion of new junk bonds 
 for example a recent $ N million offering of <@@ unk@@ > gas services l.@@ p. bonds sold by first bo@@ ston was three times over@@ subscribed 
 a $ N million offering of tur@@ ner broadcasting system in@@ c high-@@ yield securi@@ ties sold last week by dre@@ x@@ el was increased $ N million because of strong demand 
 first bo@@ ston estimates that in nove@@ mber and dece@@ mber alone junk bond investors will receive $ N billion of coupon interest payments 
 that 's a clear indication that there is and will be an <@@ unk@@ > of basic business going on says m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > of first bo@@ ston 
 i do n't know how people can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were $ N billion of orders for $ N million of junk bonds sold last week by tur@@ ner says ra@@ y@@ mond <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > of merchant banking at mer@@ ri@@ ll ly@@ n@@ ch & co 
 when the rally comes insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will 
 there is plenty of money available from people who want to buy <@@ unk@@ > deals it 's the stuff that 's fin@@ anced on a <@@ unk@@ > that people are w@@ ary of 
 but such highly le@@ ver@@ aged transactions seemed to have <@@ unk@@ > this year casting a p@@ all over much of the junk market 
 mic@@ ha@@ el <@@ unk@@ > director of fix@@ ed-@@ income research at ke@@ mper financial services says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer contributing to the slide in prices 
 last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals he says 
 this year at best it 's in one in every five or six 
 and our credit standards have n't changed one <@@ unk@@ > 
 however m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said the slide in junk is creating one hell of a buying opportunity for selec@@ tive buyers 
 for the moment investors seem more <@@ unk@@ > with the bad junk than the good junk 
 the market has been weak since the announcement of the ca@@ m@@ pe@@ au cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent ba@@ il@@ out by olymp@@ ia & y@@ ork says m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > of mer@@ ri@@ ll ly@@ n@@ ch 
 that really affected the market in that people started to ask what else is in trouble 
 well before ca@@ m@@ pe@@ au though there were signs that the junk market was <@@ unk@@ > through one of its worst years ever 
 despite the relatively strong economy junk bond prices did nothing except go down <@@ unk@@ > by a seemingly endless trail of bad news 
 in j@@ une two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ N billion of spe@@ cu@@ lative debt securi@@ ties new y@@ or@@ k-@@ based integrated resources inc@@ . said it ran out of borrowed money 
 in july sou@@ th@@ mark cor@@ p. the d@@ all@@ as@@ -based real estate and financial services company with about $ N billion of junk bonds voluntarily filed for protection under u@@ .s@@ . bankruptcy law 
 by the end of july the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven@@ -year treas@@ ury notes wid@@ ened to more than N percentage points 
 in au@@ gust resorts international inc@@ . which sold more than $ N million of junk bonds suspended interest payments 
 in september just as the cash squeeze hit ca@@ m@@ pe@@ au <@@ unk@@ > financial cor@@ p. de@@ faul@@ ted on $ N million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ N billion of debt securi@@ ties 
 meantime regul@@ ators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to le@@ verage shows no signs of <@@ unk@@ > 
 moody 's says the frequency of corporate credit <@@ unk@@ > is the highest this year since N 
 in addition there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of N according to the federal deposit insurance cor@@ p 
 the era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it says ja@@ mes grant editor of grant 's interest rate <@@ unk@@ > an early critic of the junk bond market 
 what we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying <@@ unk@@ > compound interest 
 businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings 
 what we 're seeing now is the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > of asset values to a future when <@@ unk@@ > debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy 
 friday 's market activity 
 prices of treas@@ ury bonds sur@@ ged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a <@@ unk@@ > stock market 
 the ben@@ ch@@ mark 30@@ -year treas@@ ury bond was quoted N p.m. ed@@ t at N N compared with N N thursday up N N points 
 the yield on the ben@@ ch@@ mark fell to N N the lowest since march N N according to technical data global markets group 
 the flight to quality began late in the day and followed a <@@ unk@@ > fall in the stock market 
 treas@@ ur@@ ys opened lower reacting <@@ unk@@ > to news that the producer price index a measure of inflation on the whole@@ sale level accelerated in september 
 bond prices barely <@@ unk@@ > until midday 
 many bond market participants will be closely <@@ unk@@ > the action of the federal reserve which might repeat its oc@@ to@@ ber N injection of huge amounts of liqui@@ dity to <@@ unk@@ > the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession 
 prices of munici@@ pals invest@@ ment-@@ grade <@@ unk@@ > and mort@@ g@@ age-@@ backed bonds also rose but lag@@ ged behind their treas@@ ury counterparts 
 mort@@ gage securi@@ ties rose in hectic trading with most of the activity concentrated in government national mort@@ gage association N N coupon securi@@ ties the most liquid mort@@ gage issue 
 the gin@@ nie mae nove@@ mber N N issue ended at N N up N point on the day to yield about N N to a 12@@ -year average life assumption 
 invest@@ ment-@@ grade corporate bonds were up about N to N point 
 but the yield spread between <@@ unk@@ > invest@@ ment-@@ grade issues and <@@ unk@@ > bonds wid@@ ened 
 and the yiel@@ ds on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other invest@@ ment-@@ grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ N billion bond offering by the ten@@ ne@@ ssee valley authority 
 despite rumors that the t@@ va 's long-@@ awaited offering would be postponed because of the deb@@ acle in the equ@@ ity markets sources in the under@@ writing syn@@ dic@@ ate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled 
 one of the sources said the smaller portions of $ N million each of five-@@ year and 10-@@ year bonds have already been substantially over@@ subscribed 
 municipal bonds rose as much as N point

 friday 's 190@@ -@@ point plun@@ ge in stocks does not come <@@ unk@@ > the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their N oc@@ to@@ ber crash and <@@ unk@@ > have been put in place to keep markets more orderly 
 still the lesson is about the same on friday the 13th the market was sp@@ oo@@ ked by wash@@ ington 
 the consensus along the street seems to be that the plun@@ ge was triggered by the financing problems of the u@@ al take@@ over and it 's certainly true the r@@ out began immediately after the u@@ al trading halt 
 still the consensus seems almost as wide that one <@@ unk@@ > bid is no reason to write down the value of all u@@ .s@@ . business 
 this <@@ unk@@ > leads us to another piece of news moving on the d@@ ow j@@ ones <@@ unk@@ > shortly before the downturn the success of sen@@ ate demo@@ crats in <@@ unk@@ > the capital gains tax cut 
 the real value of all shares after all is directly <@@ unk@@ > by the tax on any profits all the more so given the limits on deduc@@ tions for losses that show gains are not ordinary income 
 and market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the house last month 
 an hour before friday 's plun@@ ge that provision was stri@@ pped from the tax bill leaving it with $ N billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut 
 there is a great deal to be said to be sure for <@@ unk@@ > the garbage out of the reconci@@ li@@ ation bill 
 it would be a good thing if congress started to decide issues <@@ unk@@ > on their individual merits without <@@ unk@@ > 
 for one thing no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an <@@ unk@@ > vote 
 since sen@@ ate leaders have so far <@@ unk@@ > it up with proce@@ d@@ ural <@@ unk@@ > promises of a cleaner bill are suspect 
 especially so since president bush has been weakened by the pan@@ ama <@@ unk@@ > 
 to the extent that the u@@ al troubles contributed to the plun@@ ge they are another instance of wash@@ ington 's <@@ unk@@ > fingers 
 as the best opportunities for corporate re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings are exhausted of course at some point the market will start to reject them 
 but the airlines are <@@ unk@@ > a clear case given anti-@@ take@@ over <@@ unk@@ > by secretary of transportation skin@@ ner who <@@ unk@@ > to believe safety will be <@@ unk@@ > if <@@ unk@@ > and british air@@ ways own interests in companies that fly airplanes 
 worse congress has started to jump on the skin@@ ner <@@ unk@@ > 
 ja@@ mes <@@ unk@@ > the min@@ ne@@ sota demo@@ cr@@ at who chairs the public works and transportation committee 's aviation sub@@ committee has put an <@@ unk@@ > take@@ over bill on <@@ unk@@ > speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the american and united air lines bi@@ ds 
 it would give m@@ r@@ . skin@@ ner up to N days to review any bid for N N or more of the voting stock of any u@@ .s@@ . carrier with reven@@ ues of $ N billion or more 
 so the u@@ al deal has problems and the market loses N points 
 <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . secretary and m@@ r@@ . con@@ gre@@ ss@@ man 
 in the N crash remember the market was shaken by a dan@@ ny <@@ unk@@ > proposal to tax take@@ overs out of <@@ unk@@ > 
 even more important in our view was the treas@@ ury 's threat to <@@ unk@@ > the dollar 
 the treas@@ ury is doing the same thing today <@@ unk@@ > the dollar is not under <@@ unk@@ > pressure 
 also tra@@ ders are in better shape today than in N to survive selling <@@ unk@@ > 
 they are better capitalized 
 they are in less danger of losing liqui@@ dity simply because of tape <@@ unk@@ > and clearing and sett@@ lement delays 
 the fed promises any needed liqui@@ dity 
 the big board 's <@@ unk@@ > with the chic@@ ago board of trade has improved it will be interesting to learn if circuit brea@@ kers prove to be a good idea 
 in any event some tra@@ ders see stocks as <@@ unk@@ > today unlike N 
 there is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be <@@ unk@@ > by a little <@@ unk@@ > and common sense in wash@@ ington 
 but on the be@@ ari@@ sh side that may be too much to expect 
 first chic@@ ago cor@@ p. posted a third-@@ quarter loss of $ N million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans 
 the parent company of first national bank of chic@@ ago with $ N billion in assets said it set aside $ N million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries 
 the addition on top of two big N addi@@ tions to <@@ unk@@ > reserves brings the reserve to a level equ@@ aling N N of <@@ unk@@ > and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations 
 first chic@@ ago since N has reduced its loans to such nations to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 despite this loss first chic@@ ago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital 
 during the quarter the company realized a pre@@ tax gain of $ N million from the sale of its first chic@@ ago investment <@@ unk@@ > unit 
 combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped N N against last year 's third quarter to $ N million from $ N million 
 gains from first chic@@ ago 's venture capital unit a big le@@ ver@@ aged bu@@ y-@@ out invest@@ or rose N N to $ N million from $ N million a year ago

 in the <@@ unk@@ > round of voting <@@ unk@@ > gave no clear mand@@ ate to any single political party 
 the ad inter@@ im co@@ ali@@ tion government that emerged from <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > was in <@@ unk@@ > little more than the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > of ide@@ ological <@@ unk@@ > on one side the <@@ unk@@ > new democracy party headed by <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 on the other the so-called co@@ ali@@ tion of the left and progress a <@@ unk@@ > and rather dec@@ ep@@ tive title for a mer@@ ger of the <@@ unk@@ > communi@@ st party of gre@@ ece and its <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > left 
 the <@@ unk@@ > bond for this <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > was plain <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 's party as common political enemy 
 the <@@ unk@@ > goal was a <@@ unk@@ > of government corruption <@@ unk@@ > at all levels but the main marks were m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > and his <@@ unk@@ > associates 
 in point of fact this <@@ unk@@ > was over@@ due by decades 
 when reduced to <@@ unk@@ > status in <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > however the notion <@@ unk@@ > into a promised assa@@ ult with targets primarily for political gains not justice 
 with regard to gre@@ ece 's <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > scandal m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 's principal <@@ unk@@ > remains ge@@ or@@ ge <@@ unk@@ > former owner of the bank of <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > now <@@ unk@@ > in a jail cell in <@@ unk@@ > mass@@ . from where he is fighting <@@ unk@@ > proce@@ ed@@ ings that would return him to gre@@ ece 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 's credi@@ bility is at best <@@ unk@@ > 
 he has ample motive to shift the blame and his testi@@ mony has also been found less than <@@ unk@@ > on numerous points 
 nevertheless the new democracy and communi@@ st parties her@@ ald his <@@ unk@@ > as proof of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 among <@@ unk@@ > questions are whether m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > received $ N million of stolen bank of <@@ unk@@ > funds and an additional $ N in <@@ unk@@ > as con@@ tended whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ N million in m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 's bank and then <@@ unk@@ > off the interest and what <@@ unk@@ > 's cut was from the $ N million m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 two former ministers were so heavily <@@ unk@@ > in the <@@ unk@@ > affair that <@@ unk@@ > members of parliament voted to refer them to the special court 
 but <@@ unk@@ > par@@ li@@ am@@ ent@@ ary probe was the case of millions of <@@ unk@@ > m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > into new democracy <@@ unk@@ > 
 in the end the investigation produced only <@@ unk@@ > evidence and indic@@ ations that point to <@@ unk@@ > not <@@ unk@@ > proof 
 on another issue <@@ unk@@ > were told how their national intelligence agency the <@@ unk@@ > regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures including key opposition politicians journalists and <@@ unk@@ > cabinet members 
 despite convincing arguments it was never established that m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > personally ordered or directed the <@@ unk@@ > 
 the central weakness of the scandals debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and <@@ unk@@ > 
 the co@@ ali@@ tion government tried to show that <@@ unk@@ > ministers had received he@@ fty sums for <@@ unk@@ > the purchase of <@@ unk@@ > fighting fal@@ con and mir@@ age N combat aircraft produced by the <@@ unk@@ > general dynamics cor@@ p. and fr@@ ance 's <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > d@@ assa@@ ult respectively 
 naturally neither general dynamics nor d@@ assa@@ ult could be expected to <@@ unk@@ > its prospective future deal@@ ings by making disclo@@ sures of sums paid or not to various <@@ unk@@ > officials for services <@@ unk@@ > 
 so it seems that m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > and his communi@@ st <@@ unk@@ > may have <@@ unk@@ > served m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > a moral victory on a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > whether guilty or not can now <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > the whole affair as a <@@ unk@@ > hunt at m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 's expense 
 but while <@@ unk@@ > high <@@ unk@@ > alone wo n't help <@@ unk@@ > regain power m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > should never be underestimated 
 first came his predictable <@@ unk@@ > he charged the co@@ ali@@ tion of the left and progress had sold out its lef@@ tist <@@ unk@@ > by <@@ unk@@ > in a <@@ unk@@ > plot aimed at <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > the course of soci@@ alism in gre@@ ece 
 then to <@@ unk@@ > his credi@@ bility with the left he <@@ unk@@ > some smaller lef@@ tist parties to stand for election under the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 next he continued to court the communi@@ sts many of whom feel <@@ unk@@ > by the <@@ unk@@ > co@@ ali@@ tion 's birth by bringing into <@@ unk@@ > a <@@ unk@@ > communi@@ st party candidate 
 for balance and in hopes of gaining some <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > votes he managed to attract a former new democracy party representative and known political enemy of m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 
 thus <@@ unk@@ > heads for the po@@ lls not only with dimini@@ shed <@@ unk@@ > but also with <@@ unk@@ > of approval from representatives of its <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ >

 a federal appeals court in san fr@@ anci@@ sco ruled that share@@ holders ca n't hold corporate officials li@@ able for false sales projec@@ tions on new products if the news media <@@ unk@@ > revealed substantial information about the product 's flaws 
 the ruling stems from a N suit filed by share@@ holders of apple computer inc@@ . claiming that company officials <@@ unk@@ > investors about the expected success of the <@@ unk@@ > computer introduced in N 
 lawyers specializing in share@@ holder suits said they are concerned that use of the press defense by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling 
 according to the suit apple officials created public excitement by tou@@ ting <@@ unk@@ > as an office computer that would <@@ unk@@ > the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year 
 the pla@@ inti@@ ffs also alle@@ ged that prior to the fan@@ fare the company circul@@ ated internal <@@ unk@@ > indicating problems with <@@ unk@@ > 
 the suit claimed apple 's stock climbed to a high of $ N a share on the basis of the company 's optimistic forecasts 
 but when the company revealed <@@ unk@@ > 's poor sales late in N the stock plu@@ mme@@ ted to a low of $ N a share according to the suit 
 the share@@ holders claimed more than $ N million in losses 
 in N the san fr@@ anci@@ sco district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently <@@ unk@@ > the company 's statements by <@@ unk@@ > consumers to <@@ unk@@ > 's problems 
 late last month the appeals court agreed that most of the case should be dismissed 
 however it gave the share@@ holders the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that <@@ unk@@ > to <@@ unk@@ > 's disk drive known as <@@ unk@@ > 
 the court ruled that the news media did n't reveal <@@ unk@@ > 's problems at the time 
 lawyers are worried about the ruling 's implication in other share@@ holder suits but pointed out that the court stressed that the ruling should be regarded as very specific to the apple case 
 the court was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the company 's statements said patri@@ ck <@@ unk@@ > a los angel@@ es lawyer at the firm of <@@ unk@@ > & <@@ unk@@ > which was n't involved in the case 
 the court is saying that the adverse facts have to be transferred to the market with equal intensity and credi@@ bility as the statements of corporate insi@@ ders

 n@@ f@@ l ordered to pay $ N million in legal fees to <@@ unk@@ > 
 the national football league is considering appealing the ruling ste@@ mming from the u@@ .s@@ . football league 's largely unsuccessful anti@@ trust suit against the n@@ f@@ l 
 a jury in N agreed with the <@@ unk@@ > 's claims that the n@@ f@@ l <@@ unk@@ > major league football 
 but the jury awarded the <@@ unk@@ > only $ N in damages <@@ unk@@ > because of the anti@@ trust claims 
 last week the u@@ .s@@ . court of appeals in new y@@ ork up@@ held a $ N million award of attor@@ neys fees to the <@@ unk@@ > league 
 <@@ unk@@ > d. <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > & <@@ unk@@ > then of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > & <@@ unk@@ > was the lead trial lawyer and his new firm pursued the application appeal 
 dou@@ gla@@ s r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > & <@@ unk@@ > says about $ N million of the award goes directly to the <@@ unk@@ > to rei@@ mbur@@ se it for fees already paid 
 <@@ unk@@ > & <@@ unk@@ > will get about $ N for the costs of pressing the application 
 the federal appeals court held that the nomin@@ al damages and the failure to prove all claims did n't exclude the <@@ unk@@ > from being <@@ unk@@ > 
 anti@@ trust laws provide that injured parties may be <@@ unk@@ > for lawyers ' fees 
 but <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > an attorney for the n@@ f@@ l says his client will consider asking for another hearing or appealing to the u@@ .s@@ . supreme court 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > s@@ late <@@ unk@@ > & fl@@ om in new y@@ ork says the ruling is wrong and the fee award is excessive because the <@@ unk@@ > lost its major claims including its <@@ unk@@ > that the n@@ f@@ l <@@ unk@@ > trade through television contracts

 in addition <@@ unk@@ > & <@@ unk@@ > 's wash@@ ington d.@@ c@@ . office will play a key role as the firms work together on regul@@ atory issues particularly natural-@@ gas exports for their clients 
 the arrangement reached after about eight months of negotiations grew out of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > ro@@ ber@@ t@@ son 's desire to develop ties with a u@@ .s@@ . firm in light of <@@ unk@@ > trade barriers between the u@@ .s@@ . and canada said fr@@ anc@@ is m. <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > ro@@ ber@@ t@@ son

 trading <@@ unk@@ > up friday in the market for high-@@ yield junk bonds often used to finance take@@ overs 
 it was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk bond market where prices began weak@@ ening last month after ca@@ m@@ pe@@ au hit a cash cr@@ unch

 on friday <@@ unk@@ > shares fell N N to close at N N 
 for the broader market the greatest significance of the <@@ unk@@ > deal may be that it was put together late friday night after the market r@@ out and involves a $ N million temporary bridge loan from don@@ al@@ d@@ son lu@@ f@@ kin & j@@ en@@ re@@ tte securi@@ ties and a $ N million loan from security p@@ acific national bank

 the market and investment ban@@ kers are even less <@@ unk@@ > about companies that have had at least one bid mer@@ ger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already 
 given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market tra@@ ders fear that these transactions may be revised yet again

 people familiar with hil@@ ton said over the weekend that the <@@ unk@@ > of the sel@@ l-@@ off in hil@@ ton shares was un@@ warran@@ ted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on jun@@ k-@@ bond financing 
 however they conce@@ ded that some potential bi@@ dd@@ ers would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the u@@ al bu@@ y-@@ out group <@@ unk@@ > a general <@@ unk@@ > among banks to provide credit for <@@ unk@@ > take@@ overs 
 hil@@ ton officials said they were n't worried about the drop in the company 's stock 
 wi@@ lli@@ am <@@ unk@@ > hil@@ ton 's general coun@@ sel said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are on track for what has been described previously as a slow and <@@ unk@@ > process 
 i ca n't believe that any potential buyer for hil@@ ton would be affected by one day 's trading m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said 
 but the stock market as a whole bol@@ stered as it is by take@@ over spe@@ culation remains vulnerable to any further <@@ unk@@ > by take@@ over financi@@ ers both in the <@@ unk@@ > market and among commercial banks 
 for <@@ unk@@ > suit@@ ors the take@@ over game has been over for some time says new y@@ ork money manager ne@@ il <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > capital who has been keeping N N of his portfolio in cash 
 the market is just <@@ unk@@ > up to that point 
 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > in los angel@@ es contributed to this column 
 of all the one-@@ time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease 
 to take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment however the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms 
 it must also evaluate the real-@@ estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective 
 specifically it must understand how real-@@ estate markets <@@ unk@@ > to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities 
 when a regional economy <@@ unk@@ > cold the local real-@@ estate market gets <@@ unk@@ > 
 in other words real-@@ estate market indic@@ ators such as building per@@ mits and leas@@ ing activity plu@@ m@@ met much further than a local economy in recession 
 this was seen in the late 1960s in los angel@@ es and the mid-@@ 1970s in new y@@ ork 
 but the reverse is also true when a region 's economy <@@ unk@@ > from a slow@@ down these real-@@ estate indic@@ ators will re@@ bound far faster than the improving economy 
 why do local real-@@ estate markets <@@ unk@@ > to regional economic cycles 
 because real-@@ estate purchases and leas@@ es are such major long-term commit@@ ments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth 
 metropolitan de@@ tro@@ it was written off economically during the early 1980s as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment 
 area employment dropped by N N from its N peak and retail sales were down N N 
 however the real-@@ estate market was hurt even more 
 for example residential building per@@ mits in the tr@@ ough year of N were off N N from the N peak level 
 once metropolitan de@@ tro@@ it 's economy r@@ al@@ lied in the mid-@@ 1980s real estate re@@ b@@ ounded 
 building per@@ mits for example so@@ ared a stag@@ g@@ ering N N between N and the peak year of N 
 where <@@ unk@@ > corporations and professional firms are now asking are today 's opportunities 
 look no further than metropolitan hou@@ ston and den@@ ver two of the most depressed over@@ built and potentially under@@ valued real-@@ estate markets in the nation 
 of course some ob@@ servers have tou@@ ted hou@@ ston and den@@ ver for the past five years as a <@@ unk@@ > play 
 but now appears to be the time to act 
 metropolitan hou@@ ston 's economy did drop and then <@@ unk@@ > in the years after its N peak 
 in the mid-@@ 1980s employment was down as much as N N from the N peak and retail sales were off N N 
 the real-@@ estate market suffered even more severe setbacks 
 office construction dropped N N 
 the vac@@ ancy rate so@@ ared more than N N in nearly every product category and more than N N of office space was vacant 
 to some ob@@ servers the empty office buildings of hou@@ ston 's <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > were <@@ unk@@ > of a very troubled economy 
 as usual the real-@@ estate market had <@@ unk@@ > 
 actually the region 's economy re@@ tained a firm foundation 
 metropolitan hou@@ ston 's population has held steady over the past six years 
 and personal income after <@@ unk@@ > in the mid-@@ 1980s has returned to its N level in real dollar terms 
 today metropolitan hou@@ ston 's real-@@ estate market is po@@ ised for a significant turn@@ around 
 more than N jobs were added in <@@ unk@@ > hou@@ ston last year primarily in bio@@ technology petro@@ chemical processing and the computer industry 
 this growth puts hou@@ ston in the top five <@@ unk@@ > areas in the nation last year 
 and forecasts project a N N to N N growth rate in jobs over the next few years nearly twice the national average 
 den@@ ver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-@@ estate market has <@@ unk@@ > to the region 's economic trends although den@@ ver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as hou@@ ston 
 by some measures metropolitan den@@ ver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years 
 its population has continued to increase since N the peak year of the economic cycle 
 employment is now N N higher than in N 
 buying income in real dollars actually increased N N between N and N the most recent year available 
 the rates of increase however are less than the rapid growth of the boom years and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy 
 in a <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > therefore the region 's real-@@ estate market all but collapsed in recent years 
 housing building per@@ mits are down more than N N from their N <@@ unk@@ > 
 although no one can predict when metropolitan den@@ ver 's real-@@ estate market will re@@ bound major public works projects co@@ sting several billion dollars are under way or planned such as a new convention center a major <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > the metropolitan area and a new regional airport 
 when den@@ ver 's regional economy begins to grow faster such a recovery could occur as early as next year business and consumer confidence will return and the resulting explosion of real-@@ estate activity will <@@ unk@@ > the general economic re@@ bound 
 what real-@@ estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as hou@@ ston 's or den@@ ver 's 
 generally over@@ capacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-@@ 1980s peak even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as wash@@ ington new y@@ ork and los angel@@ es 
 vac@@ ancy rates in the N N to N N range today may easily rise to the low to <@@ unk@@ > N range in a couple of years 
 under these conditions even a <@@ unk@@ > out of economic growth catching cold in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bar@@ gains as the <@@ unk@@ > industry <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 those looking for real-@@ estate bar@@ gains in <@@ unk@@ > metropolitan areas should lock in leas@@ es or buy now those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term three-@@ year lease and wait for the bar@@ gains ahead

 common cause asked both the sen@@ ate ethics committee and the justice department to investigate $ N million in political gifts by ari@@ zona businessman char@@ les ke@@ ating to five u@@ .s@@ . sen@@ ators who <@@ unk@@ > with <@@ unk@@ > regul@@ ators for him 
 m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating is currently the subject of a $ N billion federal <@@ unk@@ > law@@ suit <@@ unk@@ > him of bleeding off assets of a cali@@ for@@ nia thri@@ ft he controlled lin@@ coln savings & loan association and driving it into <@@ unk@@ >

 i want to say in the most <@@ unk@@ > way i can i certainly hope so 
 in a highly unusual meeting in sen@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 's office in april N the five sen@@ ators asked federal regul@@ ators to ease up on lin@@ coln 
 according to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting the regul@@ ators said lin@@ coln was gambling <@@ unk@@ > with <@@ unk@@ > ' feder@@ ally in@@ sured money and was a <@@ unk@@ > time bomb 
 m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating had complained that the regul@@ ators were being too <@@ unk@@ > 
 the notes show that sen@@ . <@@ unk@@ > called the federal home loan bank board 's regulations gro@@ ss@@ ly unfair and that sen@@ . gl@@ en@@ n insisted that m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating 's thri@@ ft was viable and profitable 
 for the next two years the bank board which at the time was the agency responsible for <@@ unk@@ > thri@@ fts failed to act even after federal audi@@ tors warned in may N that m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating had caused lin@@ coln to become in@@ sol@@ vent 
 lin@@ coln 's parent company american contin@@ ental cor@@ p. entered bank@@ rupt@@ c@@ y-@@ law proce@@ ed@@ ings this april N and regul@@ ators seized the thri@@ ft the next day 
 the newly formed resolution trust cor@@ p. successor to the bank board filed suit against m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating and several others on sep@@ t. N 
 m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating has filed his own suit alle@@ ging that his property was taken illegally 
 the cost to tax@@ payers of lin@@ coln 's collapse has been estimated at as much as $ N billion 
 details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers 
 in the midst of his N re-@@ election campaign sen@@ . <@@ unk@@ > chairman of the sen@@ ate banking committee returned $ N in contributions after a de@@ tro@@ it newspaper said that m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regul@@ ators 
 sen@@ . <@@ unk@@ > after months of <@@ unk@@ > off intense press criticism returned $ N only last month shortly after the government formally accused m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating of <@@ unk@@ > lin@@ coln 
 in addition sen@@ . <@@ unk@@ > last week disclosed that he <@@ unk@@ > had paid $ N to american contin@@ ental as <@@ unk@@ > for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating 's vacation home at cat <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > from N through N 
 sen@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter fell between the cracks 
 m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating his family members and associates also donated $ N to sen@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 's con@@ gre@@ ssional campaigns over the years according to press accounts 
 but sen@@ . <@@ unk@@ > says m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating broke off their friendship abruptly in N because the sen@@ ator refused to press the thri@@ ft executive 's case as vigorously as m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating wanted 
 he became very angry at that left my office and told a number of people that i was a <@@ unk@@ > sen@@ . <@@ unk@@ > rec@@ alls 
 in july cali@@ for@@ nia newspapers disclosed that m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating gave $ N in corporate funds to three tax@@ -@@ exemp@@ t vo@@ ter registration organizations in N and N at the <@@ unk@@ > of sen@@ . cran@@ ston who conce@@ ded that so@@ lic@@ iting the money was a pretty stupid thing to do politically 
 in addition sen@@ . cran@@ ston received $ N in campaign donations through m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating and the cali@@ for@@ nia democratic party received $ N in corporate donations for a N <@@ unk@@ > drive that benefited the sen@@ ator 's re-@@ election campaign that year 
 also in july o@@ hi@@ o newspapers disclosed $ N in corporate donations by m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating to the national council on public policy a political committee controlled by sen@@ . gl@@ en@@ n 
 that was in addition to $ N in direct campaign donations arranged by m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating to the o@@ hi@@ o sen@@ ator 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said the sen@@ ate ethics committee should hire a special outside coun@@ sel to conduct an investigation as was done in the case of former house speaker ja@@ mes wri@@ ght 
 wil@@ son <@@ unk@@ > staff director of the ethics panel would n't comment 
 sen@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said he would cooperate with any inquiry but that his conduct had been entirely proper 
 sen@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said he had been deeply concerned at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper but decided it was entirely appropriate for him to seek fair treatment for a <@@ unk@@ > 
 sen@@ . gl@@ en@@ n said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and i am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the sen@@ ate ethics committee 
 sen@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said when all is said and done i expect to be fully <@@ unk@@ > 
 sen@@ . cran@@ ston who had already <@@ unk@@ > his help to the federal burea@@ u of investigation in any investigation of m@@ r@@ . ke@@ ating portrayed his role in N as <@@ unk@@ > regul@@ ators to act

 when china opened its doors to foreign investors in N toy makers from h@@ ong kong were among the first to march in 
 today with about N N of the companies ' products being made in china the chairman of the h@@ ong kong toys council den@@ nis <@@ unk@@ > has suggested a new <@@ unk@@ > label made in china by h@@ ong kong companies 
 the toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the british colony 
 but in the wake of the <@@ unk@@ > in bei@@ jing on j@@ une N the h@@ ong kong toy industry is worrying about its strong <@@ unk@@ > on china 
 although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by china 's political tur@@ mo@@ il they are looking for additional sites 
 the toy makers and their foreign buyers cite uncertainty about china 's economic and political policies 
 nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket says da@@ vid <@@ unk@@ > chairman and chief executive officer of international <@@ unk@@ > group l@@ t@@ d 
 indeed <@@ unk@@ > and other leading h@@ ong kong toy makers were setting up factories in southeast asia especially in th@@ ail@@ and long before the massac@@ re 
 their steps were partly promp@@ ted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern china 
 by diversi@@ fying supply sources the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from china manufacturers and foreign buyers say 
 it would n't be easy to <@@ unk@@ > quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern china during the past decade 
 a supply of cheap labor and the access to h@@ ong kong 's port airport banks and support industries such as printing companies have made china 's <@@ unk@@ > province a premier manufacturing site 
 south china is the most competitive source of toys in the world says hen@@ ry <@@ unk@@ > executive director of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > toys con@@ soli@@ dated l@@ t@@ d 
 h@@ ong kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border 
 in N exports of domes@@ tically produced toys and games fell N N from N to h@@ k@@ $ N billion us@@ $ N billion 
 but <@@ unk@@ > mainly from china jumped N N to h@@ k@@ $ N billion 
 in N 's first seven months domestic exports fell N N to h@@ k@@ $ N billion while <@@ unk@@ > rose N N to h@@ k@@ $ N billion 
 manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern china where an estimated N people are employed by the toy industry 
 for the next few years like it or not china is going to be the main supplier says <@@ unk@@ > young vice president of <@@ unk@@ > enterprises l@@ t@@ d. one of the first big h@@ ong kong toy makers to move across the border 
 in the meantime as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites they are focusing mainly on southeast asia 
 several big companies have established manufacturing joint v@@ entures in th@@ ail@@ and including <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > industrial co@@ . the toy manufacturer headed by m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 
 mal@@ ay@@ sia the phi@@ lipp@@ ines and in@@ done@@ sia also are being studied 
 with the eur@@ op@@ ean community set to remove its internal trade barriers in N several h@@ ong kong companies are beginning to consider spa@@ in por@@ tu@@ gal and gre@@ ece as possible manufacturing sites 
 worries about china came just as h@@ ong kong 's toy industry was recovering from a N sales slump and bankruptcy fil@@ ings by two major u@@ .s@@ . companies <@@ unk@@ > of wonder inc@@ . and <@@ unk@@ > industries in@@ c 
 h@@ ong kong manufacturers say large debt <@@ unk@@ > and other financial problems resulting from the N difficulties <@@ unk@@ > the local industry causing it to ti@@ ghten credit policies and financial management 
 the industry <@@ unk@@ > last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results 
 still they long for a <@@ unk@@ > toy to <@@ unk@@ > retail sales in the u@@ .s@@ . h@@ ong kong 's biggest market for toys and games 
 the <@@ unk@@ > thing the colony 's companies have to a u@@ .s@@ . <@@ unk@@ > this year is the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > series of action figures manufactured by <@@ unk@@ > hol@@ dings l@@ t@@ d

 should sales continue to be strong through the christmas season which accounts for about N N of u@@ .s@@ . retail toy sales m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > said the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > could make N a record sales year for <@@ unk@@ > 
 other h@@ ong kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from N 
 besides the lack of a <@@ unk@@ > product they cite the continued domin@@ ance of the u@@ .s@@ . market by <@@ unk@@ > entertainment system an expensive video game made by <@@ unk@@ > co@@ . of japan 
 <@@ unk@@ > buyers have little money left to spend on other products 
 many of the toy makers ' problems started well before j@@ une N as a result of <@@ unk@@ > infrastructure and bei@@ jing 's <@@ unk@@ > programs launched late last year 
 toy makers complain that electricity in <@@ unk@@ > has been provided only three days a week in recent months down from five days a week as the province 's rapid <@@ unk@@ > has <@@ unk@@ > its generating capacity 
 manufacturers are upgrading <@@ unk@@ > power plants 
 bank credit for china investments all but <@@ unk@@ > up following j@@ une N 
 also concern exists that the <@@ unk@@ > bei@@ jing leadership will ti@@ ghten its control of <@@ unk@@ > which has been the main laboratory for the <@@ unk@@ > policy and economic reforms 
 but toy manufacturers and other <@@ unk@@ > say bei@@ jing will be <@@ unk@@ > from ti@@ ghten@@ ing controls on <@@ unk@@ > southern china 
 they say china 's trade deficit is wid@@ ening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to <@@ unk@@ > production in <@@ unk@@ > 
 the chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports says m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > of <@@ unk@@ > 
 the bush administration ur@@ ging the supreme court to give states more <@@ unk@@ > to restrict abor@@ tions said <@@ unk@@ > have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents 
 <@@ unk@@ > general ken@@ ne@@ th <@@ unk@@ > argued that the N supreme court decision roe vs. wa@@ de recognizing a constitu@@ tional right to abortion was incorrect 
 he also argued that the high court was wrong in N to rule that <@@ unk@@ > have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely ve@@ to@@ ed by their parents 
 the administration 's position was out@@ lined in a <@@ unk@@ > brief filed in one of three abortion cases the supreme court will hear argued and will decide this term 
 the administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a min@@ ne@@ sota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion 
 the administration urged the jus@@ tices to adopt a legal standard suggested by chief justice wi@@ lli@@ am <@@ unk@@ > last july when the high court up@@ held miss@@ ouri 's abortion restrictions 
 under that standard which <@@ unk@@ > the votes of only three of the nine jus@@ tices a state restriction of abortion is constitu@@ tional if the state has a reasonable <@@ unk@@ > for adopting it 
 that is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the supreme court 's test since N which requires a state to have a compelling reason for restri@@ cting abortion 
 on the pro@@ visions of the min@@ ne@@ sota law the bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows <@@ unk@@ > to go to court for a judge 's permission instead

 aluminum co@@ . of america hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas said net income for the third quarter dropped N N to $ N million or $ N a share 
 the nation 's no@@ . N aluminum maker earned $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 analy@@ sts who were expecting <@@ unk@@ > to post around $ N to $ N a share were surprised at the l@@ ack@@ lu@@ ster third-@@ quarter results 
 it 's disappointing said wi@@ lli@@ am <@@ unk@@ > an analy@@ st with smith bar@@ ney har@@ ris up@@ ham & co 
 much of the earnings decline was led by <@@ unk@@ > rate adjust@@ ments which affected the bottom line by $ N million or N cents a share compared with $ N million or four cents a share the previous year 
 lower prices for aluminum <@@ unk@@ > and certain <@@ unk@@ > products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings the company said 
 in addition costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant <@@ unk@@ > for modernization work the company said 
 excluding the higher tax rate which rose two percentage points to N N and the negative exchange rate adjustment the company would have met analy@@ sts ' expectations said r@@ . way@@ ne <@@ unk@@ > an analy@@ st with gold@@ man s@@ achs & co

 for N years federal rules have bar@@ red the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lu@@ cra@@ tive and fast@@ est-@@ growing parts of the television business 
 and for six years nb@@ c ab@@ c and c@@ bs have negotiated with ho@@ lly@@ wood studi@@ os in a <@@ unk@@ > attempt to change that 
 but with foreign companies <@@ unk@@ > up u@@ .s@@ . movie studi@@ os the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever 
 they hope the foreign deals will divide the ho@@ lly@@ wood opposition and <@@ unk@@ > congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from <@@ unk@@ > a piece of <@@ unk@@ > sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air 
 even network executives however admit privately that victory either in congress or in talks with the studi@@ os is highly doubtful any time soon 
 and so the networks also are pushing for new ways to <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > pro@@ visions known formally as the financial interest and <@@ unk@@ > rules 
 that became clear last week with the disclosure that national broadcasting co@@ . backed by the deep pockets of parent general electric co@@ . had tried to help fund q@@ int@@ ex austra@@ lia l@@ t@@ d. 's <@@ unk@@ > $ N billion bid for m@@ g@@ m\/@@ ua communications co 
 nb@@ c 's interest may revive the deal which m@@ g@@ m\/@@ ua killed last week when the austra@@ lian concern had trouble raising cash 
 even if that deal is n't revived nb@@ c hopes to find another 
 our doors are open an nb@@ c spo@@ kes@@ man says 
 nb@@ c may yet find a way to take a passive minority interest in a <@@ unk@@ > without viol@@ ating the rules 
 and any nb@@ c effort could prompt c@@ bs inc@@ . and ab@@ c 's parent capital ci@@ ti@@ es\/@@ ab@@ c inc@@ . to look for ways of <@@ unk@@ > the <@@ unk@@ > regulations

 both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing <@@ unk@@ > restrain@@ ts 
 few people <@@ unk@@ > to the talks expect the studi@@ os to <@@ unk@@ > 
 the networks still are <@@ unk@@ > in their authority over what shows get on the air charges motion picture association president jack <@@ unk@@ > the most <@@ unk@@ > opponent of <@@ unk@@ > the rules 
 studi@@ os are <@@ unk@@ > to get shows in pri@@ me@@ -time <@@ unk@@ > and keep them there long enough to go into lu@@ cra@@ tive <@@ unk@@ > sales he con@@ tends 
 and that 's why the rules for the most part must stay in place he says 
 studio executives in on the talks including officials at par@@ amount communications inc@@ . <@@ unk@@ > entertainment inc@@ . war@@ ner communications inc@@ . and m@@ ca inc@@ . declined to be interviewed 
 but m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > who represents the studi@@ os asser@@ ts the whole production industry to a man is on the side of preserving the rules 
 such <@@ unk@@ > leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studi@@ os will <@@ unk@@ > 
 they do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate says one network executive 
 and there 's no indication that wash@@ ington is prepared to address the rules 
 that 's the problem is n't it 
 indeed it is 
 congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess ur@@ ging the studi@@ os and the networks which license rights to air shows made by the studi@@ os to work out their own compromise

 he did n't mention that nb@@ c in the meantime was hoping to assist austra@@ lia 's q@@ int@@ ex in buying 
 an nb@@ c spo@@ kes@@ man <@@ unk@@ > that m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 's <@@ unk@@ > was entirely consistent with nb@@ c plans because the u@@ .s@@ . rules would limit nb@@ c 's involvement in the q@@ int@@ ex deal so severely as to be light years away from the type of <@@ unk@@ > deals available to son@@ y and everyone else except the three networks 
 the big three 's <@@ unk@@ > for der@@ e@@ gu@@ lation began <@@ unk@@ > in the summer when the former time inc@@ . went ahead with plans to acquire war@@ ner

 <@@ unk@@ > rules do n't <@@ unk@@ > block a network from buying a passive small stake in a company that profits from the <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > networks ca n't enjoy

 if the transaction raised objec@@ tions the studio 's <@@ unk@@ > operations could be sp@@ un off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake

 the networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim for several years at the least 
 six years ago they were <@@ unk@@ > close 
 the <@@ unk@@ > federal communications commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules 
 various evidence including a <@@ unk@@ > institution study of some N series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s showed the networks did n't <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > control over the studi@@ os as had been alle@@ ged

 network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influ@@ x builds more support in wash@@ ington but that seems unlikely

 recognition equipment inc@@ . said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the u@@ .s@@ . post@@ al service 
 the government sued the company in april seeking $ N and other un@@ specified damages related to an alle@@ ged <@@ unk@@ > scheme 
 the suit named the company former chief executive officer wi@@ lli@@ am g. mo@@ ore j@@ r@@ . former vice president ro@@ bert w@@ . <@@ unk@@ > and five def@@ end@@ ants who were n't part of the company 
 the suit charged the def@@ end@@ ants with causing pe@@ ter e. <@@ unk@@ > an <@@ unk@@ > of the post@@ al service board of govern@@ ors to accept $ N in <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > 
 m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $ N for his role in the scheme 
 in the agreement recognition agreed to pay the government $ N in return for the release of all claims against the company m@@ r@@ . mo@@ ore and m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > 
 the five additional def@@ end@@ ants were n't parties to the sett@@ lement 
 a trial on criminal alle@@ gations against the company and the same two former executives began sep@@ t. N in federal court for the district of colu@@ mb@@ ia 
 they were indic@@ ted last oc@@ to@@ ber on charges of fraud theft and con@@ spir@@ acy related to an effort to win $ N million in post@@ al service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment 
 the company and its executives deny the charges 
 in a related development recognition equipment said the post@@ al service has bar@@ red the company from bi@@ dding on post@@ al contracts for an additional N days 
 the post@@ al service originally suspended the company oc@@ t. N N and has been renew@@ ing the ban ever since 
 the company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension

 the big semiconduc@@ tor and computer maker said it had net of $ N million or N cents down N N from $ N million or N cents a share 
 the lower net included a charge of $ N million equal to N cents a share on an after-@@ tax basis for the cost of aband@@ oning a <@@ unk@@ > joint venture with si@@ e@@ mens a@@ g of west ger@@ many

 in@@ tel 's stock rose in early over-@@ the-@@ counter trading friday as investors appeared relieved that the company 's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter 's earnings of $ N million or N cents a share and that sales actually exceeded the $ N million for the second period 
 but in@@ tel later <@@ unk@@ > to the stock market 's plun@@ ge closing at $ N down $ N 
 in au@@ gust in@@ tel warned that third-@@ quarter earnings might be flat to down from the previous period 's because of slowing sales growth of its N microp@@ ro@@ cess@@ or star@@ t-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass ship@@ ments of the company 's new N chip in the current quarter

 wal@@ ter si@@ su@@ lu and the afri@@ can national congress came home yesterday 
 after N years in prison m@@ r@@ . si@@ su@@ lu the <@@ unk@@ > former <@@ unk@@ > of the liber@@ ation movement was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up 
 at the same time six an@@ c colleagues five of whom were arrested with him in N and sentenced to life <@@ unk@@ > were <@@ unk@@ > with their families at various places around the country 
 and as the <@@ unk@@ > men returned to their homes the an@@ c out@@ law@@ ed in south afri@@ ca since N and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government <@@ unk@@ > returned to the streets of the country 's black <@@ unk@@ > 
 a huge an@@ c flag with black green and gold <@@ unk@@ > was <@@ unk@@ > over the <@@ unk@@ > gate at m@@ r@@ . si@@ su@@ lu 's modest house while on the street out front boys displayed the an@@ c colors on their shirts <@@ unk@@ > and <@@ unk@@ > 
 at the small <@@ unk@@ > home of <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > a leading an@@ c <@@ unk@@ > and a former <@@ unk@@ > in the group 's armed <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > we <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > stuck little an@@ c flags in their hair and a man <@@ unk@@ > on an <@@ unk@@ > horn <@@ unk@@ > in an@@ c <@@ unk@@ > 
 i am happy to see the spirit of the people said m@@ r@@ . si@@ su@@ lu looking <@@ unk@@ > in a new gray suit 
 as the crowd outside his home shouted an@@ c an@@ c the old man shot his <@@ unk@@ > into the air 
 i 'm inspired by the mood of the people 
 under the laws of the land the an@@ c remains an illegal organization and its headquarters are still in <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > 
 but the <@@ unk@@ > release of the seven leaders who once formed the intellectual and <@@ unk@@ > core of the an@@ c is a de <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > of the movement and the <@@ unk@@ > of its internal <@@ unk@@ > 
 the government can never put the an@@ c back into the bottle again said <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > a veter@@ an <@@ unk@@ > activi@@ st on hand to welcome m@@ r@@ . si@@ su@@ lu 
 things have gone too far for the government to stop them now 
 there 's no turning back 
 there was certainly no <@@ unk@@ > the tide of an@@ c <@@ unk@@ > last night when hundreds of people <@@ unk@@ > into the <@@ unk@@ > cross <@@ unk@@ > church in <@@ unk@@ > for what became the first an@@ c rally in the country in N years 
 <@@ unk@@ > <@@ unk@@ > of an@@ c and <@@ unk@@ > we <@@ unk@@ > shook the church as the seven aging men v@@ owed that the an@@ c would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial <@@ unk@@ > on all fron@@ ts including the armed struggle 
 and they called on the government to release ne@@ l@@ son <@@ unk@@ > the an@@ c 's leading figure who was ja@@ iled with them and remains in prison 
 without him said m@@ r@@ . si@@ su@@ lu the <@@ unk@@ > of the others is only a <@@ unk@@ > 
 president <@@ unk@@ > de <@@ unk@@ > released the an@@ c men along with one of the founding members of the pan <@@ unk@@ > congress a rival liber@@ ation group as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving bl@@ acks a voice in national government 
 but pre@@ tori@@ a may instead be creating a climate for more tur@@ mo@@ il and uncertainty in this <@@ unk@@ > divided country 
 as other <@@ unk@@ > governments particularly po@@ land and the so@@ viet union have recently discovered initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult if not impossible to control 
 as the days go by the south afri@@ can government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued <@@ unk@@ > of m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > as well as the continued banning of the an@@ c and en@@ forcement of the state of emergency 
 if it does n't yield on these matters and eventually begin talking directly to the an@@ c the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to <@@ unk@@ > and un@@ rest 
 if it does the large number of <@@ unk@@ > whites who oppose any con@@ ces@@ sions to the black majority will step up their <@@ unk@@ > and threats to take matters into their own hands 
 the newly released an@@ c leaders also will be under enormous pressure 
 the government is watching closely to see if their presence in the <@@ unk@@ > leads to increased <@@ unk@@ > protests and violence if it does pre@@ tori@@ a will use this as a reason to keep m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > behind bars 
 pre@@ tori@@ a has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life <@@ unk@@ > in the first place for s@@ abo@@ tage and con@@ spir@@ acy to <@@ unk@@ > the government 
 in addition the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the an@@ c and between the newly freed leaders and those activi@@ sts who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their <@@ unk@@ > 
 in order to head off any divisions m@@ r@@ . <@@ unk@@ > in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released instructed them to report to the an@@ c headquarters in <@@ unk@@ > as soon as possible 
 the men also will be faced with <@@ unk@@ > the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many <@@ unk@@ > black <@@ unk@@ > the so-called young <@@ unk@@ > who are anxious to see the old <@@ unk@@ > in action 
 says pe@@ ter <@@ unk@@ > president of the south afri@@ can youth congress we will be expecting them to act like leaders of the an@@ c 
 they never considered themselves to be anything else 
 at last night 's rally they called on their <@@ unk@@ > to be firm yet disciplined in their opposition to ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id 
 we <@@ unk@@ > discipline because we know that the government is very very sensitive said and@@ re@@ w <@@ unk@@ > another early <@@ unk@@ > leader who is now N 
 we want to see ne@@ l@@ son <@@ unk@@ > and all our <@@ unk@@ > out of prison and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us
